<h5>CHAPTER XVII.</h5>

<h4>SENSATION.</h4>


<p>After inner perception, outer perception! The next
three chapters will treat of the processes by which we cognize
at all times the present world of space and the material
things which it contains. And first, of the process
called Sensation.</p>


<h4>SENSATION AND PERCEPTION DISTINGUISHED.</h4>


<p><i>The words Sensation and Perception</i> do not carry very
definitely discriminated meanings in popular speech, and in
Psychology also their meanings run into each other. Both
of them name processes in which we cognize an objective
world; both (under normal conditions) need the stimulation
of incoming nerves ere they can occur; Perception
always involves Sensation as a portion of itself; and Sensation
in turn never takes place in adult life without Perception
also being there. They are therefore names for different
cognitive <i>functions</i>, not for different sorts of mental
<i>fact</i>. The nearer the object cognized comes to being a
simple quality like 'hot,' 'cold,' 'red,' 'noise,' 'pain,' apprehended
irrelatively to other things, the more the state
of mind approaches pure sensation. The fuller of relations
the object is, on the contrary; the more it is something
classed, located, measured, compared, assigned to a function,
etc., etc.; the more unreservedly do we call the state
of mind a perception, and the relatively smaller is the part
in it which sensation plays.</p>

<p><i>Sensation, then, so long as we take the analytic point of</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<i>view, differs from Perception only in the extreme simplicity of its
object or content.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Its function is that of mere <i>acquaintance</i>
with a fact. Perception's function, on the other hand, is
knowledge <i>about</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a fact; and this knowledge admits of
numberless degrees of complication. But in both sensation
and perception we perceive the fact as an <i>immediately
present outward reality</i>, and this makes them differ from
'thought' and 'conception,' whose objects do not appear
present in this immediate physical way. <i>From the physiological</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<i>point of view both sensations and perceptions differ from
'thoughts'</i> (in the narrower sense of the word) <i>in the fact that
nerve-currents coming in from the periphery are involved in their
production. In perception these nerve-currents arouse voluminous
associative or reproductive processes in the cortex; but when
sensation occurs alone, or with a minimum of perception, the accompanying
reproductive processes are at a minimum too.</i></p>

<p>I shall in this chapter discuss some general questions
more especially relative to Sensation. In a later chapter
perception will take its turn. I shall entirely pass by the
classification and natural history of our special 'sensations,'
such matters finding their proper place, and being
sufficiently well treated, in all the physiological books.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>


<h4>THE COGNITIVE FUNCTION OF SENSATION.</h4>


<p><i>A pure sensation is an abstraction;</i> and when we adults
talk of our 'sensations' we mean one of two things: either
certain <i>objects</i>, namely simple <i>qualities</i> or <i>attributes</i> like
<i>hard, hot, pain;</i> or else those of our thoughts in which
acquaintance with these objects is least combined with
knowledge about the relations of them to other things. As
we can only think or talk about the relations of objects
with which we have <i>acquaintance</i> already, we are forced to
postulate a function in our thought whereby we first become
aware of the <i>bare immediate natures</i> by which our several
objects are distinguished. This function is sensation.
And just as logicians always point out the distinction
between substantive terms of discourse and relations found
to obtain between them, so psychologists, as a rule, are
ready to admit this function, of the vision of the terms or
matters meant, as something distinct from the knowledge
about them and of their relations <i>inter se</i>. Thought with
the former function is sensational, with the latter, intellectual.
Our earliest thoughts are almost exclusively sensational.
They merely give us a set of <i>thats</i>, or <i>its</i>, of subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of discourse, with their relations not brought out. The first
time we see <i>light</i>, in Condillac's phrase we <i>are</i> it rather
rather than see it. But all our later optical knowledge is
about what this experience gives. And though we were
struck blind from that first moment, our scholarship in the
subject would lack no essential feature so long as our memory
remained. In training-institutions for the blind they
teach the pupils as much <i>about</i> light as in ordinary schools.
Reflection, refraction, the spectrum, the ether-theory, etc.,
are all studied. But the best taught born-blind pupil of
such an establishment yet lacks a knowledge which the
least instructed seeing baby has. They can never show him
what light is in its 'first intention'; and the loss of that
sensible knowledge no book-learning can replace. All this
is so obvious that we usually find sensation 'postulated'
as an element of experience, even by those philosophers who
are least inclined to make much of its importance, or to
pay respect to the knowledge which it brings.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>But the trouble is that most, if not all, of those who
admit it, admit it as a fractional <i>part</i> of the thought, in the
old-fashioned atomistic sense which we have so often criticised.</p>

<p>Take the pain called toothache for example. Again
and again we feel it and greet it as the same real item in
the universe. We must therefore, it is supposed, have a
distinct pocket for it in our mind into which it and nothing
else will fit. This pocket, when filled, is the sensation of
toothache; and must be either filled or half-filled whenever
and under whatever form toothache is present to our
thought, and whether much or little of the rest of the
mind be filled at the same time. Thereupon of course
comes up the paradox and mystery: If the knowledge of
toothache be pent up in this separate mental pocket, how
can it be known <i>cum alio</i> or brought into one view with
anything else? This pocket knows nothing else; no other
part of the mind knows toothache. The knowing of toothache
<i>cum alio</i> must be a miracle. And the miracle must
have an Agent. And the Agent must be a Subject or Ego
'out of time,'&mdash;and all the rest of it, as we saw in Chapter
X. And then begins the well-worn round of recrimination
between the sensationalists and the spiritualists, from which
we are saved by our determination from the outset to accept
the psychological point of view, and to admit knowledge
whether of simple toothaches or of philosophic systems as
an ultimate fact. There are realities and there are 'states
of mind,' and the latter know the former; and it is just as
wonderful for a state of mind to be a 'sensation' and know
a simple pain as for it to be a thought and know a system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of related things.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But there is no reason to suppose that
when different states of mind know different things about
the same toothache, they do so by virtue of their all <i>containing</i>
faintly or vividly the original pain. Quite the reverse.
The by-gone sensation of my gout was painful, as
Reid somewhere says; the <i>thought</i> of the same gout as by-gone
is pleasant, and in no respect resembles the earlier
mental state.</p>

<p>Sensations, then, first make us acquainted with innumerable
things, and then are replaced by thoughts which
know the same things in altogether other ways. And
Locke's main doctrine remains eternally true, however
hazy some of his language may have been, that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"though there be a great number of considerations wherein things may
be compared one with another, and so a multitude of relations; yet
they all <i>terminate in</i>, and are concerned about, those simple ideas<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
either of sensation or reflection, which I think to be the whole materials
of all our knowledge.... The simple ideas we receive from sensation
and reflection are the <i>boundaries</i> of our thoughts; beyond which, the
mind whatever efforts it would make, is not able to advance one jot; nor
can it make any discoveries when it would pry into the nature and
hidden causes of those ideas."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The nature and hidden causes of ideas will never be
unravelled till the <i>nexus</i> between the brain and consciousness
is cleared up. All we can say now is that sensations
are <i>first</i> things in the way of consciousness. Before conceptions
can come, sensations must have come; but before
sensations come, no psychic fact need have existed, a nerve-current
is enough. If the nerve-current be not given,
nothing else will take its place. To quote the good Locke
again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not in the power of the most exalted wit or enlarged understanding,
by any quickness or variety of thoughts, to invent or frame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
one new simple idea [i.e. sensation] in the mind.... I would have
any one try to fancy any taste which had never affected his palate, or
frame the idea of a scent he had never smelt; and when he can do this,
I will also conclude that a blind man hath ideas of colors, and a deaf
man true distinct notions of sounds."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The brain is so made that all currents in it run one way.
Consciousness of some sort goes with all the currents, but
it is only when new currents are entering that it has the
sensational <i>tang</i>. And it is only then that consciousness
directly <i>encounters</i> (to use a word of Mr. Bradley's) a reality
outside itself.</p>

<p>The difference between such encounter and all conceptual
knowledge is very great. A blind man may know all
<i>about</i> the sky's blueness, and I may know all <i>about</i> your
toothache, conceptually; tracing their causes from primeval
chaos, and their consequences to the crack of doom. But
so long as he has not felt the blueness, nor I the toothache,
our knowledge, wide as it is, of these realities, will be hollow
and inadequate. Somebody must <i>feel</i> blueness, somebody
must <i>have</i> toothache, to make human knowledge of these
matters real. Conceptual systems which neither began nor
left off in sensations would be like bridges without piers.
Systems about fact must plunge themselves into sensation
as bridges plunge their piers into the rock. Sensations are
the stable rock, the <i>terminus a quo</i> and the <i>terminus ad quem</i>
of thought. To find such termini is our aim with all our
theories&mdash;to conceive first when and where a certain sensation
may be had, and then to have it. Finding it stops discussion.
Failure to find it kills the false conceit of
knowledge. Only when you deduce a possible sensation
for me from your theory, and give it to me when and where
the theory requires, do I begin to be sure that your thought
has anything to do with truth.</p>

<p><i>Pure sensations can only be realized in the earliest days of life.</i>
They are all but impossible to adults with memories and
stores of associations acquired. Prior to all impressions
on sense-organs the brain is plunged in deep sleep and consciousness
is practically non-existent. Even the first weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
after birth are passed in almost unbroken sleep by human
infants. It takes a strong message from the sense-organs to
break this slumber. In a new-born brain this gives rise to
an absolutely pure sensation. But the experience leaves
its 'unimaginable touch' on the matter of the convolutions,
and the next impression which a sense-organ transmits
produces a cerebral reaction in which the awakened vestige
of the last impression plays its part. Another sort of feeling
and a higher grade of cognition are the consequence;
and the complication goes on increasing till the end of life,
no two successive impressions falling on an identical brain,
and no two successive thoughts being exactly the same.
(See Vol. I, p. 230 ff.)</p>

<p><i>The first sensation which an infant gets is for him the Universe.</i>
And the Universe which he later comes to know is
nothing but an amplification and an implication of that first
simple germ which, by accretion on the one hand and intussusception
on the other, has grown so big and complex
and articulate that its first estate is unrememberable. In
his dumb awakening to the consciousness of <i>something there</i>,
a mere <i>this</i> as yet (or something for which even the term
<i>this</i> would perhaps be too discriminative, and the intellectual
acknowledgment of which would be better expressed
by the bare interjection 'lo!'), the infant encounters an object
in which (though it be given in a pure sensation) all
the 'categories of the understanding' are contained. <i>It has
objectivity, unity, substantiality, causality, in the full sense in
which any later object or system of objects has these things.</i>
Here the young knower meets and greets his world; and
the miracle of knowledge bursts forth, as Voltaire says, as
much in the infant's lowest sensation as in the highest
achievement of a Newton's brain. The physiological condition
of this first sensible experience is probably nerve-currents
coming in from many peripheral organs at once.
Later, the one confused Fact which these currents cause to
appear is perceived to be many facts, and to contain many
qualities.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> For as the currents vary, and the brain-paths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
are moulded by them, other thoughts with other 'objects'
come, and the 'same thing' which was apprehended as a
present <i>this</i> soon figures as a past <i>that</i>, about which many
unsuspected things have come to light. The principles of
this development have been laid down already in Chapters
XII and XIII, and nothing more need here be added to
that account.</p>


<h4>"THE RELATIVITY OF KNOWLEDGE."</h4>


<p>To the reader who is tired of so much <i>Erkenntnisstheorie</i>
I can only say that I am so myself, but that it is indispensable,
in the actual state of opinions about Sensation, to try
to clear up just what the word means. Locke's pupils seek
to do the impossible with sensations, and against them we
must once again insist that sensations 'clustered together'
cannot build up our more intellectual states of mind.
Plato's earlier pupils used to admit Sensation's existence,
grudgingly, but they trampled it in the dust as something
corporeal, non-cognitive, and vile.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> His latest followers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
seem to seek to crowd it out of existence altogether. The
only reals for the neo-Hegelian writers appear to be <i>relations</i>,
relations without terms, or whose terms are only
speciously such and really consist in knots, or gnarls of
relations finer still <i>in infinitum</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Exclude from what we have considered real all qualities constituted
by relation, we find that none are left." "Abstract the many
relations from the one thing and there is nothing.... Without the
relations it would not exist at all."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> "The single feeling is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
real." "On the recognition of relations as constituting the <i>nature</i> of
ideas, rests the possibility of any tenable theory of their reality."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such quotations as these from the late T. H. Green<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
would be matters of curiosity rather than of importance,
were it not that sensationalist writers themselves believe in
a so-called 'Relativity of Knowledge,' which, if they only
understood it, they would see to be identical with Professor
Green's doctrine. They tell us that the relation of sensations
to each other is something belonging to their essence,
and that no one of them has an absolute content:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That, e.g., black can only be felt in contrast to white, or at least
in distinction from a paler or a deeper black; similarly a tone or a sound
only in alternation with others or with silence; and in like manner a
smell, a taste, a touch, only, so to speak, <i>in statu nascendi</i>, whilst, when
the stimulus continues, all sensation disappears. This all seems at first
sight to be splendidly consistent both with itself and with the facts.
But looked at more closely, it is seen that neither is the case."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>The two leading facts from which the doctrine of universal
relativity derives its wide-spread credit are these:</p>

<p>1) The <i>psychological fact</i> that so much of our actual
knowledge <i>is</i> of the relations of things&mdash;even our simplest
sensations in adult life are habitually referred to classes
as we take them in; and</p>

<p>2) The <i>physiological fact</i> that our senses and brain must
have periods of change and repose, else we cease to feel and
think.</p>

<p>Neither of these facts proves anything about the
presence or non-presence to our mind of absolute qualities
with which we become sensibly acquainted. Surely
not the psychological fact; for our inveterate love of
relating and comparing things does not alter the intrinsic
qualities or nature of the things compared, or undo
their absolute givenness. And surely not the physiological
fact; for the length of time during which we can
feel or attend to a quality is altogether irrelevant to the
intrinsic constitution of the quality felt. The time, moreover,
is long enough in many instances, as sufferers from
neuralgia know.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> And the doctrine of relativity, not proved
by these facts, is flatly disproved by other facts even more
patent. So far are we from not knowing (in the words of
Professor Bain) "any one thing by itself, but only the difference
between it and another thing," that if this were true
the whole edifice of our knowledge would collapse. If all
we felt were the <i>difference</i> between the <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, or <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>,
on the musical scale, that being the same in the two pairs
of notes, the pairs themselves would be the same, and language
could get along without substantives. But Professor
Bain does not mean seriously what he says, and we need
spend no more time on this vague and popular form of the
doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The facts which seem to hover before the minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of its champions are those which are best described under
the head of a physiological law.</p>


<h4>THE LAW OF CONTRAST.</h4>


<p>I will first enumerate the main facts which fall under
this law, and then remark upon what seems to me their significance
for psychology.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>[Nowhere are the phenomena of contrast better exhibited,
and their laws more open to accurate study, than in
connection with the sense of sight. Here both kinds&mdash;simultaneous
and successive&mdash;can easily be observed, for
they are of constant occurrence. Ordinarily they remain
unnoticed, in accordance with the general law of economy
which causes us to select for conscious notice only such
elements of our object as will serve us for æsthetic or practical
utility, and to neglect the rest; just as we ignore the
double images, the <i>mouches volantes</i>, etc., which exist for
everyone, but which are not discriminated without careful
attention. But by attention we may easily discover the
general facts involved in contrast. We find that <i>in general
the color and brightness of one object always apparently affect the
color and brightness of any other object seen simultaneously with
it or immediately after</i>.</p>

<p>In the first place, if we look for a moment at any surface
and then turn our eyes elsewhere, the complementary color
and opposite degree of brightness to that of the first surface
tend to mingle themselves with the color and the brightness
of the second. This is <i>successive contrast</i>. It finds its explanation
in the fatigue of the organ of sight, causing it to
respond to any particular stimulus less and less readily the
longer such stimulus continues to act. This is shown clearly
in the very marked changes which occur in case of continued
fixation of one particular point of any field. The field
darkens slowly, becomes more and more indistinct, and
finally, if one is practised enough in holding the eye perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
steady, slight differences in shade and color may
entirely disappear. If we now turn aside the eyes, a negative
after-image of the field just fixated at once forms, and
mingles its sensations with those which may happen to
come from anything else looked at. This influence is distinctly
evident only when the first surface has been 'fixated'
without movement of the eyes. It is, however, none the
less present at all times, even when the eye wanders from
point to point, causing each sensation to be modified more
or less by that just previously experienced. On this account
successive contrast is almost sure to be present in
cases of simultaneous contrast, and to complicate the
phenomena.</p>

<p>A <i>visual image is modified not only by other sensations just
previously experienced, but also by all those experienced simultaneously
with it, and especially by such as proceed from contiguous
portions of the retina</i>. This is the phenomenon of
<i>simultaneous contrast</i>. In this, as in successive contrast, both
brightness and hue are involved. A bright object appears
still brighter when its surroundings are darker than itself,
and darker when they are brighter than itself. Two colors
side by side are apparently changed by the admixture, with
each, of the complement of the other. And lastly, a gray
surface near a colored one is tinged with the complement
of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The phenomena of simultaneous contrast in sight are so
complicated by other attendant phenomena that it is difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to isolate them and observe them in their purity. Yet
it is evidently of the greatest importance to do so, if one
would conduct his investigations accurately. Neglect of
this principle has led to many mistakes being made in
accounting for the facts observed. As we have seen, if the
eye is allowed to wander here and there about the field as
it ordinarily does, successive contrast results and allowance
must be made for its presence. It can be avoided only by
carefully fixating with the well-rested eye a point of one
field, and by then observing the changes which occur in
this field when the contrasting field is placed by its side.
Such a course will insure pure simultaneous contrast. But
even thus it lasts in its purity for a moment only. It
reaches its maximum of effect immediately after the introduction
of the contrasting field, and then, if the fixation is
continued, it begins to weaken rapidly and soon disappears;
thus undergoing changes similar to those observed when
any field whatever is fixated steadily and the retina becomes
fatigued by unchanging stimuli. If one continues still
further to fixate the same point, the color and brightness
of one field tend to spread themselves over and mingle with
the color and brightness of the neighboring fields, thus
substituting '<i>simultaneous induction</i>' for simultaneous contrast.</p>

<p>Not only must we recognize and eliminate the effects of
successive contrast, of temporal changes due to fixation,
and of simultaneous induction, in analyzing the phenomena
of simultaneous contrast, but we must also take into account
<i>various other influences which modify its effects</i>. Under favorable
circumstances the contrast-effects are very striking,
and did they always occur as strongly they could not fail
to attract the attention. But they are not always clearly
apparent, owing to various disturbing causes which form no
exception to the laws of contrast, but which have a modifying
effect on its phenomena. When, for instance, the
ground observed has many distinguishable features&mdash;a
<i>coarse grain, rough surface, intricate pattern,</i> etc.&mdash;the contrast
effect appears weaker. This does not imply that the
effects of contrast are absent, but merely that the resulting
sensations are overpowered by the many other stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
sensations which entirely occupy the attention. On such a
ground a faint negative after-image&mdash;undoubtedly due to
retinal modifications&mdash;may become invisible; and even
weak objective differences in color may become imperceptible.
For example, a faint spot or grease-stain on
woollen cloth, easily seen at a distance, when the fibres are
not distinguishable, disappears when closer examination
reveals the intricate nature of the surface.</p>

<p>Another frequent cause of the apparent absence of contrast
is the presence of narrow dark intermediate fields, such
as are formed by <i>bordering a field with black lines, or by the
shaded contours of objects</i>. When such fields interfere with
the contrast, it is because black and white can absorb much
color without themselves becoming clearly colored; and
because such lines separate other fields too far for them to
distinctly influence one another. Even weak objective
differences in color may be made imperceptible by such
means.</p>

<p>A third case where contrast does not clearly appear is
where the <i>color of the contrasting fields is too weak or too intense</i>,
or where there is <i>much difference in brightness between the
two fields</i>. In the latter case, as can easily be shown, it is
the contrast of brightness which interferes with the color-contrast
and makes it imperceptible. For this reason contrast
shows best between fields of about equal brightness.
But the intensity of the color must not be too great, for then
its very darkness necessitates a dark contrasting field which
is too absorbent of induced color to allow the contrast to
appear strongly. The case is similar if the fields are too
light.</p>

<p><i>To obtain the best contrast-effects, therefore, the contracting
fields should be near together, should not be separated by shadows
or black lines, should be of homogeneous texture, and should be of
about equal brightness and medium intensity of color.</i> Such
conditions do not often occur naturally, the disturbing influences
being present in case of almost all ordinary objects,
thus making the effects of contrast far less evident. To
eliminate these disturbances and to produce the conditions
most favorable for the appearance of good contrast-effects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
various experiments have been devised, which will be explained
in comparing the rival theories of explanation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are <i>two theories&mdash;the psychological and the physiological</i>&mdash;which
attempt to explain the phenomena of contrast.</p>

<p>Of these the <i>psychological one</i> was the first to gain prominence.
<i>Its most able advocate has been Helmholtz. It explains
contrast as a</i> <span class="smcap">deception of judgment</span>. In ordinary life our
sensations have interest for us only so far as they give
us practical knowledge. Our chief concern is to recognize
objects, and we have no occasion to estimate exactly their
absolute brightness and color. Hence we gain no facility
in so doing, but neglect the constant changes in their shade,
and are very uncertain as to the exact degree of their
brightness or tone of their color. When objects are near
one another "we are inclined to consider those differences
which are clearly and surely perceived as greater than
those which appear uncertain in perception or which must
be judged by aid of memory,"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> just as we see a medium-sized
man taller than he really is when he stands beside a
short man. Such deceptions are more easily possible in
the judgment of small differences than of large ones;
also where there is but one element of difference instead of
many. In a large number of cases of contrast, in all
of which a whitish spot is surrounded on all sides by
a colored surface&mdash;Meyer's experiment, the mirror experiment,
colored shadows, etc., soon to be described&mdash;the
contrast is produced, according to Helmholtz, by the fact
that "a colored illumination or a transparent colored covering
appears to be spread out over the field, and observation
does not show directly that it fails on the white
spot."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> We therefore believe that we see the latter
through the former color. Now</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Colors have their greatest importance for us in so far as they are
properties of bodies and can serve as signs for the recognition of
bodies.... We have become accustomed, in forming a judgment in
regard to the colors of bodies, to eliminate the varying brightness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
color of the illumination. We have sufficient opportunity to investigate
the same colors of objects in full sunshine, in the blue light of the clear
sky, in the weak white light of a cloudy day, in the reddish-yellow light
of the sinking sun or of the candle. Moreover the colored reflections
of surrounding objects are involved. Since we see the same colored
objects under these varying illuminations, we learn to form a correct
conception of the color of the object in spite of the difference in illumination,
i.e. to judge how such an object would appear in white illumination;
and since only the constant color of the object interests us,
we do not become conscious of the particular sensations on which our
judgment rests. So also we are at no loss, when we see an object
through a colored covering, to distinguish what belongs to the color of
the covering and what to the object. In the experiments mentioned we
do the same also where the covering over the object is not at all colored,
because of the deception into which we fall, and in consequence of which
we ascribe to the body a false color, the color complementary to the
colored portion of the covering."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We think that we see the complementary color through
the colored covering,&mdash;for these two colors together would
give the sensation of white which is actually experienced.
If, however, in any way the white spot is recognized as an
independent object, or if it is compared with another object
known to be white, our judgment is no longer deceived
and the contrast does not appear.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As soon as the contrasting field is recognized as an independent
body which lies above the colored ground, or even through an adequate
tracing of its outlines is seen to be a separate field, the contrast
disappears. Since, then, the judgment of the spatial position, the
material independence, of the object in question is decisive for the
determination of its color, it follows that the contrast-color arises not
through an act of sensation but through an act of judgment."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In short, the apparent change in color or brightness
through contrast is due to no change in excitation of the
organ, to no change in sensation; but in consequence of a
false judgment the unchanged sensation is wrongly interpreted,
and thus leads to a changed <i>perception</i> of the brightness
or color.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In opposition to this theory has been developed one
which attempts to explain all cases of contrast as depending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
purely on <i>physiological action of the terminal apparatus of
vision. Hering is the most prominent supporter of this view.</i>
By great originality in devising experiments and by insisting
on rigid care in conducting them, he has been able to
detect the faults in the psychological theory and to practically
establish the validity of his own. Every visual sensation,
he maintains, is correlated to a physical process in the
nervous apparatus. Contrast is occasioned, not by a false
idea resulting from unconscious conclusions, but by the
fact that the excitation of any portion of the retina&mdash;and
the consequent sensation&mdash;depends not only on its own
illumination, but on that of the rest of the retina as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If this psycho-physical process is aroused, as usually happens, by
light-rays impinging on the retina, its nature depends not only on the
nature of these rays, but also on the constitution of the entire nervous
apparatus which is connected with the organ of vision, and on the state
in which it finds itself."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When a limited portion of the retina is aroused by external
stimuli, the rest of the retina, and especially the
immediately contiguous parts, tends to react also, and in
such a way as to produce therefrom the sensation of the
opposite degree of brightness and the complementary color
to that of the directly-excited portion. When a gray spot
is seen alone, and again when it appears colored through
contrast, the objective light from the spot is in both cases
the same. Helmholtz maintains that the neural process
and the corresponding <i>sensation</i> also remain unchanged, but
are differently <i>interpreted</i>; Hering, that the neural process
and the sensation are themselves changed, and that the
'interpretation' is the direct conscious correlate of the
altered retinal conditions. According to the one, the contrast
is psychological in its origin; according to the other,
it is purely physiological. In the cases cited above where
the contrast-color is no longer apparent&mdash;on a ground with
many distinguishable features, on a field whose borders are
traced with black lines, etc.,&mdash;the psychological theory, as
we have seen, attributes this to the fact that under these
circumstances we judge the smaller patch of color to be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
independent object on the surface, and are no longer deceived
in judging it to be something over which the color
of the ground is drawn. The physiological theory, on the
other hand, maintains that the contrast-effect is still produced,
but that the conditions are such that the slight
changes in color and brightness which it occasions become
imperceptible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two theories, stated thus broadly, may seem equally
plausible. Hering, however, has conclusively proved, by
experiments with after-images, that the process on one part
of the retina does modify that on neighboring portions,
under conditions where deception of judgment is impossible.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
A careful examination of the facts of contrast will
show that its phenomena must be due to this cause. <i>In all
the cases which one may investigate it will be seen that the upholders
of the psychological theory have failed to conduct their
experiments with sufficient care.</i> They have not excluded
successive contrast, have overlooked the changes due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
steady fixation, and have failed to properly account for the
various modifying influences which have been mentioned
above. We can easily establish this if we examine the most
striking experiments in simultaneous contrast.</p>

<p>Of these one of the best known and most easily arranged
is that known as <i>Meyer's experiment</i>. A scrap of gray paper
is placed on a colored background, and both are covered
by a sheet of transparent white paper. The gray spot then
assumes a contrast-color, complementary to that of the
background, which shines with a whitish tinge through the
paper which covers it. Helmholtz explains the phenomenon
thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the background is green, the covering-paper itself appears to be
of a greenish color. If now the substance of the paper extends without
apparent interruption over the gray which lies under it, we think that
we see an object glimmering through the greenish paper, and such an
object must in turn be rose-red, in order to give white light. If, however,
the gray spot has its limits so fixed that it appears to be an independent
object, the continuity with the greenish portion of the surface
fails, and we regard it as a gray object which lies on this surface."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The contrast-color may thus be made to disappear by
tracing in black the outlines of the gray scrap, or by placing
above the tissue paper another gray scrap of the same
degree of brightness, and comparing together the two grays.
On neither of them does the contrast-color now appear.</p>

<p>Hering<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> shows clearly that this interpretation is incorrect,
and that the disturbing factors are to be otherwise
explained. In the first place, the experiment can be so
arranged that we could not possibly be deceived into believing
that we see the gray through a colored medium.
Out of a sheet of gray paper cut strips 5 mm. wide in such
a way that there will be alternately an empty space and a
bar of gray, both of the same width, the bars being held together
by the uncut edges of the gray sheet (thus presenting
an appearance like a gridiron). Lay this on a colored background&mdash;e.g.
green&mdash;cover both with transparent paper,
and above all put a black frame which covers all the edges,
leaving visible only the bars, which are now alternately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
green and gray. The gray bars appear strongly colored
by contrast, although, since they occupy as much space as
the green bars, we are not deceived into believing that we
see the former through a green medium. The same is true
if we weave together into a basket pattern narrow strips of
green and gray and cover them with the transparent paper.</p>

<p>Why, then, if it is a true sensation due to physiological
causes, and not an error of judgment, which causes the
contrast, does the color disappear when the outlines of the
gray scrap are traced, enabling us to recognize it as an
independent object? In the first place, it does not necessarily
do so, as will easily be seen if the experiment is
tried. The contrast-color often remains distinctly visible
in spite of the black outlines. In the second place, there
are many adequate reasons why the effect should be modified.
Simultaneous contrast is always strongest at the
border-line of the two fields; but a narrow black field now
separates the two, and itself by contrast strengthens the
whiteness of both original fields, which were already little
saturated in color; and on black and on white, contrast-colors
show only under the most favorable circumstances.
Even weak objective differences in color may be made to
disappear by such tracing of outlines, as can be seen if we
place on a gray background a scrap of faintly-colored
paper, cover it with transparent paper and trace its outlines.
Thus we see that it is not the recognition of the
contrasting field as an independent object which interferes
with its color, but rather a number of entirely explicable
physiological disturbances.</p>

<p>The same may be proved in the case of holding above the
tissue paper a second gray scrap and comparing it with that
underneath. To avoid the disturbances caused by using
papers of different brightness, the second scrap should
be made exactly like the first by covering the same gray
with the same tissue paper, and carefully cutting a piece
about 10 mm. square out of both together. To thoroughly
guard against successive contrast, which so easily complicates
the phenomena, we must carefully prevent all previous
excitation of the retina by colored light. This may be
done by arranging thus: Place the sheet of tissue paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
on a glass pane, which rests on four supports; under the
paper put the first gray scrap. By means of a wire, fasten
the second gray scrap 2 or 3 cm. above the glass plate.
Both scraps appear exactly alike, except at the edges.
Gaze now at both scraps, with eyes not exactly accommodated,
so that they appear near one another, with a very
narrow space between. Shove now a colored field (green)
underneath the glass plate, and the contrast appears at
once on both scraps. If it appears less clearly on the
upper scrap, it is because of its bright and dark edges, its
inequalities, its grain, etc. When the accommodation is
exact, there is no essential change, although then on the
upper scrap the bright edge on the side toward the light,
and the dark edge on the shadow side, disturb somewhat.
By continued fixation the contrast becomes weaker and
finally yields to simultaneous induction, causing the scraps
to become indistinguishable from the ground. Remove
the green field and both scraps become green, by successive
induction. If the eye moves about freely these last-named
phenomena do not appear, but the contrast continues
indefinitely and becomes stronger. When Helmholtz found
that the contrast on the lower scrap disappeared, it was
evidently because he then really held the eye fixed. This
experiment may be disturbed by holding the upper scrap
wrongly and by the differences in brightness of its edges,
or by other inequalities, but not by that recognizing of it
'as an independent body lying above the colored ground,'
on which the psychological explanation rests.</p>

<p>In like manner the claims of the psychological explanation
can be shown to be inadequate in other cases of contrast.
Of frequent use are revolving disks, which are
especially efficient in showing good contrast-phenomena,
because all inequalities of the ground disappear and leave
a perfectly homogeneous surface. On a white disk are arranged
colored sectors, which are interrupted midway by
narrow black fields in such a way that when the disk is revolved
the white becomes mixed with the color and the
black, forming a colored disk of weak saturation on which
appears a gray ring. The latter is colored by contrast with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the field which surrounds it. Helmholtz explains the fact
thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The difference of the compared colors appears greater than it really
is either because this difference, when it is the only existing one and
draws the attention to itself alone, makes a stronger impression than
when it is one among many, or because the different colors of the surface
are conceived as alterations of the one ground-color of the surface
such as might arise through shadows falling on it, through colored
reflexes, or through mixture with colored paint or dust. In truth, to
produce an objectively gray spot on a green surface, a reddish coloring
would be necessary."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This explanation is easily proved false by painting the
disk with narrow green and gray concentric rings, and giving
each a different saturation. The contrast appears
though there is no ground-color, and no longer a single difference,
but many. The facts which Helmholtz brings forward
in support of his theory are also easily turned against
him. He asserts that if the color of the ground is too intense,
or if the gray ring is bordered by black circles, the
contrast becomes weaker; that no contrast appears on a
white scrap held over the colored field; and that the gray
ring when compared with such scrap loses its contrast-color
either wholly or in part. Hering points out the inaccuracy
of all these claims. Under favorable conditions it is impossible
to make the contrast disappear by means of black enclosing
lines, although they naturally form a disturbing
element; increase in the saturation of the field, if disturbance
through increasing brightness-contrast is to be avoided,
demands a darker gray field, on which contrast-colors
are less easily perceived; and careful use of the white scrap
leads to entirely different results. The contrast-color does
appear upon it when it is first placed above the colored
field; but if it is carefully fixated, the contrast-color diminishes
very rapidly both on it and on the ring, from causes
already explained. To secure accurate observation, all
complication through successive contrast should be avoided
thus: first arrange the white scrap, then interpose a gray
screen between it and the disk, rest the eye, set the wheel
in motion, fixate the scrap, and then have the screen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
removed. The contrast at once appears clearly, and its disappearance
through continued fixation can be accurately
watched.</p>

<p>Brief mention of a few other cases of contrast must suffice.
The so-called mirror experiment consists of placing
at an angle of 45º a green (or otherwise colored) pane of
glass, forming an angle with two white surfaces, one horizontal
and the other vertical. On each white surface is a
black spot. The one on the horizontal surface is seen through
the glass and appears dark green, the other is reflected
from the surface of the glass to the eye, and appears by
contrast red. The experiment may be so arranged that we
are not aware of the presence of the green glass, but think
that we are looking directly at a surface with green and red
spots upon it; in such a case there is no deception of judgment
caused by making allowance for the colored medium
through which we think that we see the spot, and therefore
the psychological explanation does not apply. On excluding
successive contrast by fixation the contrast soon disappears
as in all similar experiments.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><i>Colored shadows</i> have long been thought to afford a convincing
proof of the fact that simultaneous contrast is
psychological in its origin. They are formed whenever an
opaque object is illuminated from two separate sides by
lights of different colors. When the light from one source
is white, its shadow is of the color of the other light, and
the second shadow is of a color complementary to that of
the field illuminated by both lights. If now we take a tube,
blackened inside, and through it look at the colored shadow,
none of the surrounding field being visible, and then have
the colored light removed, the shadow still appears colored,
although 'the circumstances which caused it have disappeared.'
This is regarded by the psychologists as conclusive
evidence that the color is due to deception of judgment.
It can, however, easily be shown that the persistence
of the color seen through the tube is due to fatigue of the
retina through the prevailing light, and that when the
colored light is removed the color slowly disappears as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
equilibrium of the retina becomes gradually restored. When
successive contrast is carefully guarded against, the simultaneous
contrast, whether seen directly or through the tube,
never lasts for an instant on removal of the colored field.
The physiological explanation applies throughout to all the
phenomena presented by colored shadows.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>If we have a small field whose illumination remains constant,
surrounded by a large field of changing brightness,
an increase or decrease in brightness of the latter results
in a corresponding apparent decrease or increase respectively
in the brightness of the former, while the large field
seems to be unchanged. Exner says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This illusion of sense shows that we are inclined to regard as constant
the dominant brightness in our field of vision, and hence to refer
the changing difference between this and the brightness of a limited field
to a change in brightness of the latter."</p></blockquote>

<p>The result, however, can be shown to depend not on
illusion, but on actual retinal changes, which alter the sensation
experienced. The irritability of those portions of
the retina lighted by the large field becomes much reduced
in consequence of fatigue, so that the increase in brightness
becomes much less apparent than it would be without this
diminution in irritability. The small field, however, shows
the change by a change in the contrast-effect induced upon
it by the surrounding parts of the retina.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The above cases show clearly that <i>physiological processes,
and not deception of judgment, are responsible for contrast of
color</i>. To say this, however, is not to maintain that our
perception of a color is never in any degree modified by
our judgment of what the particular colored thing before us
may be. We have unquestionable illusions of color due to
wrong inferences as to what object is before us. Thus Von
Kries<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> speaks of wandering through evergreen forests covered
with snow, and thinking that through the interstices of
the boughs he saw the deep blue of pine-clad mountains, covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
with snow and lighted by brilliant sunshine; whereas
what he really saw was the white snow on trees near by,
lying in shadow].<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Such a mistake as this is undoubtedly of psychological
origin. It is a wrong <i>classification</i> of the appearances,
due to the arousal of intricate processes of association
amongst which is the suggestion of a different hue from
that really before the eyes. In the ensuing chapters such
illusions as this will be treated of in considerable detail.
But it is a mistake to interpret the simpler cases of contrast
in the light of such illusions as these. These illusions
can be rectified in an instant, and we then wonder
how they could have been. They come from insufficient
attention, or from the fact that the impression which we
get is a sign of more than one possible object, and can be
interpreted in either way. In none of these points do they
resemble simple color-contrast, which <i>unquestionably is a
phenomenon of sensation immediately aroused</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have dwelt upon the facts of color-contrast at such
great length because they form so good a text to comment
on in my struggle against the view that sensations are immutable
psychic things which coexist with higher mental
functions. Both sensationalists and intellectualists agree
that such sensations exist. They <i>fuse</i>, say the pure sensationalists,
and <i>make</i> the higher mental function; they
<i>are combined</i> by activity of the Thinking Principle, say the
intellectualists. I myself have contended that they <i>do not
exist</i> in or alongside of the higher mental function when
that exists. The things which arouse them exist; and the
higher mental function also knows these same things. But
just as its knowledge of the things supersedes and displaces
their knowledge, so it supersedes and displaces them,
when it comes, being as much as they are a direct resultant
of whatever momentary brain-conditions may obtain.
The psychological theory of contrast, on the other hand,
holds the sensations still to exist in themselves unchanged
before the mind, whilst the 'relating activity' of the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
deals with them freely and settles to its own satisfaction
what each shall be, in view of what the others also are.
Wundt says expressly that the Law of Relativity is "not a
law of sensation but a law of Apperception;" and the word
Apperception connotes with him a higher intellectual spontaneity.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
This way of taking things belongs with the philosophy
that looks at the <i>data</i> of sense as something earth-born
and servile, and the 'relating of them together' as
something spiritual and free. Lo! the spirit can even
change the intrinsic quality of the sensible facts themselves
if by so doing it can relate them better to each other! But
(apart from the difficulty of seeing how changing the sensations
should relate them better) is it not manifest that
the relations are part of the 'content' of consciousness,
part of the 'object,' just as much as the sensations are?
Why ascribe the former exclusively to the <i>knower</i> and the
latter to the <i>known</i>? The <i>knower</i> is in every case a unique
pulse of thought corresponding to a unique reaction of the
brain upon its conditions. All that the facts of contrast
show us is that the <i>same real thing</i> may give us quite
different sensations when the conditions alter, and that we
must therefore be careful which one to select as the thing's
truest representative.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>There are many other facts beside the phenomena of contrast</i>
which prove that <i>when two objects act together on us the
sensation which either would give alone becomes a different
sensation</i>. A certain amount of skin dipped in hot water
gives the perception of a certain heat. More skin immersed
makes the heat much more intense, although of course the
water's heat is the same. A certain extent as well as intensity,
in the quantity of the stimulus is requisite for any
quality to be felt. Fick and Wunderli could not distinguish
heat from touch when both were applied through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
hole in a card, and so confined to a small part of the skin.
Similarly there is a <i>chromatic minimum</i> of size in objects.
The image they cast on the retina must needs have a certain
extent, or it will give no sensation of color at all. Inversely,
more intensity in the outward impression may
make the subjective object more extensive. This happens,
as will be shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chapter XIX</a>, when the illumination
is increased: The whole room expands and dwindles according
as we raise or lower the gas-jet. It is not easy
to explain any of these results as illusions of judgment
due to the inference of a wrong objective cause for the sensation
which we get. No more is this easy in the case of
Weber's observation that a thaler laid on the skin of the
forehead feels heavier when cold than when warm; or of
Szabadföldi's observation that small wooden disks when
heated to 122° Fahrenheit often feel heavier than those
which are larger but not thus warmed;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> or of Hall's observation
that a heavy point moving over the skin seems
to go faster than a lighter one moving at the same rate of
speed.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Bleuler and Lehmann some years ago called attention
to a strange idiosyncrasy found in some persons, and consisting
in the fact that impressions on the eye, skin, etc.,
were accompanied by distinct sensations of <i>sound</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> <i>Colored
hearing</i> is the name sometimes given to the phenomenon,
which has now been repeatedly described. Quite lately the
Viennese aurist Urbantschitsch has proved that these cases
are only extreme examples of a very general law, and that
all our sense-organs influence each other's sensations.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
The hue of patches of color so distant as not to be recognized
was immediately, in U.'s patients, perceived when a
tuning-fork was sounded close to the ear. Sometimes, on
the contrary, the field was darkened by the sound. The
acuity of vision was increased, so that letters too far off to
be read could be read when the tuning-fork was heard.
Urbantschitsch, varying his experiments, found that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
results were mutual, and that sounds which were on the
limits of audibility became audible when lights of various
colors were exhibited to the eye. Smell, taste, touch, sense
of temperature, etc., were all found to fluctuate when lights
were seen and sounds were heard. Individuals varied much
in the degree and kind of effect produced, but almost every
one experimented on seems to have been in some way
affected. The phenomena remind one somewhat of the
'dynamogenic' effects of sensations upon the strength of
muscular contraction observed by M. Féré, and later to be
described. The most familiar examples of them seem to be
the increase of <i>pain</i> by noise or light, and the increase of
<i>nausea</i> by all concomitant sensations. Persons suffering in
any way instinctively seek stillness and darkness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Probably every one will agree that the best way of formulating
all such facts is physiological: it must be that the
cerebral process of the first sensation is reinforced or otherwise
altered by the other current which comes in. No one,
surely, will prefer a psychological explanation <i>here</i>. Well,
it seems to me that <i>all</i> cases of mental reaction to a plurality
of stimuli must be like these cases, and that the physiological
formulation is everywhere the simplest and the
best. When simultaneous red and green light make us see
yellow, when three notes of the scale make us hear a chord,
it is not because the sensations of red and of green and of
each of the three notes enter the mind as such, and there
'combine' or 'are combined by its relating activity' into
the yellow and the chord, it is because the larger sum of
light-waves and of air-waves arouses new cortical processes,
to which the yellow and the chord directly correspond.
Even when the sensible qualities of things enter into the
objects of our highest thinking, it is surely the same. Their
several <i>sensations</i> do not continue to exist there tucked
away. They are <i>replaced</i> by the higher thought which,
although a different psychic unit from them, knows the
same sensible qualities which they know.</p>

<p>The principles laid down in Chapter VI seem then to
be corroborated in this new connection. <i>You cannot build
up one thought or one sensation out of many; and only direct</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
<i>experiment can inform us of what we shall perceive when we
get many stimuli at once.</i></p>


<h4>THE 'ECCENTRIC PROJECTION' OF SENSATIONS.</h4>


<p>We often hear the opinion expressed that all our sensations
at first appear to us as subjective or internal, and are
afterwards and by a special act on our part 'extradited' or
'projected' so as to appear located in an outer world.
Thus we read in Professor Ladd's valuable work that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sensations... are psychical states <i>whose place</i>&mdash;so far as they can
be said to have one&mdash;<i>is the mind</i>. The transference of these sensations
from mere mental states to physical processes located in the periphery
of the body, or to qualities of things projected in space external to the
body, is a mental act. It may rather be said to be a mental <i>achievement</i>
[cf. Cudworth, <a href="#Footnote_10_10">note 10</a>, as to knowledge being <i>conquering</i>], for it is an act
which in its perfection results from a long and intricate process of development....
Two noteworthy stages, or 'epoch-making' achievements
in the process of elaborating the presentations of sense, require
a special consideration. These are '<i>localization</i>,' or the transference
of the composite sensations from mere states of the mind to processes
or conditions recognized as taking place at more or less definitely fixed
points or areas of the body; and '<i>eccentric projection</i>' (sometimes called
'eccentric perception') or the giving to these sensations an objective
existence (in the fullest sense of the word 'objective') as qualities of
objects situated within a field of space and in contact with, or more or
less remotely distant from, the body."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that there is not a vestige of evidence for
this view. It hangs together with the opinion that our sensations
are originally devoid of all spatial content,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> an
opinion which I confess that I am wholly at a loss to understand.
As I look at my bookshelf opposite I cannot frame
to myself an idea, however imaginary, of any feeling which
I could ever possibly have got from it except the feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the same big extended sort of outward fact which I now
perceive. So far is it from being true that our first way of
feeling things is the feeling of them as subjective or mental,
that the exact opposite seems rather to be the truth.
Our earliest, most instinctive, least developed kind of consciousness
is the objective kind; and only as reflection becomes
developed do we become aware of an inner world at
all. Then indeed we enrich it more and more, even to the
point of becoming idealists, with the spoils of the outer
world which at first was the only world we knew. But
subjective consciousness, aware of itself as subjective, does
not at first exist. Even an attack of pain is surely felt at
first objectively as something in space which prompts to
motor reaction, and to the very end it is located, not in the
mind, but in some bodily part.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A sensation which should not awaken an impulse to move, nor
any tendency to produce an outward effect, would manifestly be useless
to a living creature. On the principles of evolution such a sensation
could never be developed. Therefore every sensation originally
refers to something external and independent of the sentient creature.
Rhizopods (according to Engelmann's observations) retract their pseudopodia
whenever these touch foreign bodies, even if these foreign bodies
are the pseudopodia of other individuals of their own species, whilst
the mutual contact of their own pseudopodia is followed by no such
contraction. These low animals can therefore already feel an outer
world&mdash;even in the absence of innate ideas of causality, and probably
without any clear consciousness of space. In truth the conviction that
something exists outside of ourselves does not come from thought. It
comes from sensation; it rests on the same ground as our conviction of
our own existence.... If we consider the behavior of new-born
animals, we never find them betraying that they are first of all conscious
of their sensations as purely subjective excitements. We far
more readily incline to explain the astonishing certainty with which
they make use of their sensations (and which is an effect of adaptation
and inheritance) as the result of an inborn intuition of the outer world....
Instead of starting from an original pure subjectivity of sensation,
and seeking how this could possibly have acquired an objective
signification, we must, on the contrary, begin by the possession of objectivity
by the sensation and then show how for reflective consciousness
the latter becomes interpreted as an effect of the object, how in short
the original immediate objectivity becomes changed into a remote
one."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>Another confusion, much more common than the denial
of all objective character to sensations, is the assumption
that they are all originally located <i>inside the body</i> and are projected
outward by a secondary act. This secondary judgment
is always false, according to M. Taine, so far as the
place of the sensation itself goes. But it happens to <i>hit</i> a
real object which is at the point towards which the sensation
is projected; so we may call its result, according to this
author, a <i>veridical hallucination</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The word Sensation, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
begin with, is constantly, in psychological literature, used
as if it meant one and the same thing with the <i>physical impression</i>
either in the terminal organs or in the centres,
which is its antecedent condition, and this notwithstanding
that by sensation we mean a mental, not a physical, fact.
But those who expressly mean by it a mental fact still
leave to it a physical <i>place</i>, still think of it as objectively
inhabiting the very neural tracts which occasion its appearance
when they are excited; and then (going a step farther)
they think that it must <i>place itself</i> where <i>they</i> place it, or be
subjectively sensible of that place as its habitat in the
first instance, and afterwards have to be <i>moved</i> so as to
appear elsewhere.</p>

<p>All this seems highly confused and unintelligible. Consciousness,
as we saw in an earlier chapter (vol. I p. 214) cannot
properly be said to <i>inhabit</i> any place. It has dynamic relations
with the brain, and cognitive relations with everything
and anything. From the one point of view <i>we</i> may
say that a sensation is in the same place with the brain (if
we like), just as from the other point of view we may say
that it is in the same place with whatever quality it may be
cognizing. But the supposition that a sensation primitively
<i>feels either itself or its object to be in the same place with
the brain</i> is absolutely groundless, and neither <i>a priori</i>
probability nor facts from experience can be adduced to
show that such a deliverance forms any part of the original
cognitive function of our sensibility.</p>

<p>Where, then, do we feel the objects of our original sensations
to be?</p>

<p>Certainly a child newly born in Boston, who gets a sensation
from the candle-flame which lights the bedroom, or
from his diaper-pin, does not feel either of these objects to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
be situated in longitude 72° W. and latitude 41° N. He
does not feel them to be in the third story of the house. He
does not even feel them in any distinct manner to be to the
right or the left of any of the other sensations which he
may be getting from other objects in the room at the same
time. He does not, in short, know anything <i>about</i> their
space-relations to anything else in the world. The flame
fills its own place, the pain fills its own place; but as yet
these places are neither identified with, nor discriminated
from, any other places. That comes later. For the places
thus first sensibly known are elements of the child's space-world
which remain with him all his life; and by memory
and later experience he learns a vast number of things <i>about</i>
those places which at first he did not know. But to the
end of time certain places of the world remain defined for
him as the places <i>where those sensations were</i>; and his only
possible answer to the question <i>where anything is</i> will be to
say '<i>there</i>,' and to name some sensation or other like those
first ones, which shall identify the spot. Space <i>means</i> but
the aggregate of all our possible sensations. There is no
duplicate space known <i>aliunde</i>, or created by an 'epoch-making
achievement' into which our sensations, originally
spaceless, are dropped. They <i>bring</i> space and all its places
to our intellect, and do not derive it thence.</p>

<p>By his body, then, the child later means simply <i>that place
where</i> the pain from the pin, and a lot of other sensations
like it, were or are felt. It is no more true to say that he
locates that pain in his body, than to say that he locates his
body in that pain. Both are true: that pain is part of what
he <i>means by the word body</i>. Just so by the outer world the
child means nothing more than <i>that place where</i> the candle-flame
and a lot of other sensations like it are felt. He no
more locates the candle in the outer world than he locates
the outer world in the candle. Once again, he does both;
for the candle is part of what he <i>means</i> by 'outer world.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This (it seems to me) will be admitted, and will (I trust)
be made still more plausible in the chapter on the Perception
of Space. But the later developments of this perception
are so complicated that these simple principles get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
easily overlooked. One of the complications comes from
the fact that things <i>move</i>, and that the original object which
we feel them to be splits into two parts, one of which remains
as their whereabouts and the other goes off as their
quality or nature. We then contrast where they <i>were</i> with
where they <i>are</i>. If <i>we</i> do not move, the sensation of <i>where
they were</i> remains unchanged; but we ourselves presently
move, so that that also changes; and 'where they were'
becomes no longer the actual sensation which it was originally,
but a sensation which we merely conceive as possible.
Gradually the system of these possible sensations, takes
more and more the place of the actual sensations. 'Up'
and 'down' become 'subjective' notions; east and west
grow more 'correct' than 'right' and 'left' etc.; and things
get at last more 'truly' located by their relation to certain
ideal fixed co-ordinates than by their relation either to
our bodies or to those objects by which their place was
originally defined. <i>Now this revision of our original localizations
is a complex affair; and contains some facts which may
very naturally come to be described as translocations whereby
sensations get shoved farther off than they originally appeared.</i></p>

<p>Few things indeed are more striking than the changeable
distance which the objects of many of our sensations
may be made to assume. A fly's humming may be taken
for a distant steam-whistle; or the fly itself, seen out of
focus, may for a moment give us the illusion of a distant
bird. The same things seem much nearer or much farther,
according as we look at them through one end or another of
an opera-glass. Our whole optical education indeed is
largely taken up with assigning their proper distances to the
objects of our retinal sensations. An infant will grasp at the
moon; later, it is said, he projects that sensation to a distance
which he knows to be beyond his reach. In the
much quoted case of the 'young gentleman who was born
blind,' and who was 'couched' for the cataract by Mr.
Chesselden, it is reported of the patient that "when he first
saw, he was so far from making any judgment about distances,
that he thought all objects whatever touched his
eyes (as he expressed it) as what he felt did his skin."
And other patients born blind, but relieved by surgical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
operation, have been described as bringing their hand close
to their eyes to feel for the objects which they at first saw,
and only gradually stretching out their hand when they
found that no contact occurred. Many have concluded
from these facts that our earliest visual objects must seem
in immediate contact with our eyes.</p>

<p>But tactile objects also may be affected with a like ambiguity
of situation.</p>

<p>If one of the hairs of our head be pulled, we are pretty
accurately sensible of the direction of the pulling by the
movements imparted to the head.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But the feeling of the
pull is localized, not in that part of the hair's length which
the fingers hold, but in the scalp itself. This seems connected
with the fact that our hair hardly serves at all as a
tactile organ. In creatures with <i>vibrissæ</i>, however, and in
those quadrupeds whose whiskers are tactile organs, it can
hardly be doubted that the feeling is projected out of the
root into the shaft of the hair itself. We ourselves have an
approach to this when the beard as a whole, or the hair as
a whole, is touched. We perceive the contact at some distance
from the skin.</p>

<p>When fixed and hard appendages of the body, like the
teeth and nails, are touched, we feel the contact where it
objectively is, and not deeper in, where the nerve-terminations
lie. If, however, the tooth is loose, we feel two
contacts, spatially separated, one at its root, one at its
top.</p>

<p>From this ease to that of a hard body not organically
connected with the surface, but only accidentally in contact
with it, the transition is immediate. With the point of a
cane we can trace letters in the air or on a wall just as with
the finger-tip; and in so doing feel the size and shape of
the path described by the cane's tip just as immediately as,
without a cane, we should feel the path described by the
tip of our finger. Similarly the draughtsman's immediate
perception seems to be of the point of his pencil, the surgeon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the end of his knife, the duellist's of the tip of his
rapier as it plunges through his enemy's skin. When on
the middle of a vibrating ladder, we feel not only our feet
on the round, but the ladder's feet against the ground far
below. If we shake a locked iron gate we feel the middle,
on which our hands rest, move, but we equally feel the stability
of the ends where the hinges and the lock are, and
we seem to feel all three at once.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> And yet the place
where the contact is <i>received</i> is in all these cases the skin,
whose sensations accordingly are sometimes interpreted as
objects on the surface, and at other times as objects a long
distance off.</p>

<p>We shall learn in the chapter on Space that our feelings
of our own movement are principally due to the sensibility
of our rotating <i>joints</i>. Sometimes by fixing the attention,
say on our elbow-joint, we can feel the movement in the
joint itself; but we always are simultaneously conscious
of the path which during the movement our finger-tips
describe through the air, and yet these same finger-tips
themselves are in no way physically modified by the motion.
A blow on our ulnar nerve behind the elbow is felt both
there and in the fingers. Refrigeration of the elbow produces
pain in the fingers. Electric currents passed through
nerve-trunks, whether of cutaneous or of more special sensibility
(such as the optic nerve), give rise to sensations
which are vaguely localized beyond the nerve-tracts
traversed. Persons whose legs or arms have been amputated
are, as is well known, apt to preserve an illusory
feeling of the lost hand or foot being there. Even when
they do not have this feeling constantly, it may be occasionally
brought back. This sometimes is the result of
exciting electrically the nerve-trunks buried in the stump.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I recently faradized," says Dr. Mitchell, "a case of disarticulated
shoulder without warning my patient of the possible result. For two
years he had altogether ceased to feel the limb. As the current affected
the brachial plexus of nerves he suddenly cried aloud, 'Oh the hand,&mdash;the
hand!' and attempted to seize the missing member. The phantom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
I had conjured up swiftly disappeared, but no spirit could have more
amazed the man, so real did it seem."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now the apparent position of the lost extremity varies.
Often the foot seems on the ground, or follows the position
of the artificial foot, where one is used. Sometimes where
the arm is lost the elbow will seem bent, and the hand in a
fixed position on the breast. Sometimes, again, the position
is non-natural, and the hand will seem to bud straight out
of the shoulder, or the foot to be on the same level with the
knee of the remaining leg. Sometimes, again, the position
is vague; and sometimes it is ambiguous, as in another
patient of Dr. Weir Mitchell's who</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"lost his leg at the age of eleven, and remembers that the foot by
degrees approached, and at last reached the knee. When he began to
wear an artificial leg it reassumed in time its old position, and he is
never at present aware of the leg as shortened, unless for some time he
talks and thinks of the stump, and of the missing leg, when ... the
direction of attention to the part causes a feeling of discomfort, and the
subjective sensation of active and unpleasant movement of the toes.
With these feelings returns at once the delusion of the foot as being
placed at the knee."</p></blockquote>

<p>All these facts, and others like them, can easily be described
as if our sensations might be induced by circumstances
to migrate from their <i>original locality</i> near the brain
or near the surface of the body, and to appear farther off;
and (under different circumstances) to return again after
having migrated. But a little analysis of what happens
shows us that this description is inaccurate.</p>

<p><i>The objectivity with which each of our sensations originally
comes to us, the roomy and spatial character which is a primitive
part of its content, is not in the first instance relative to any
other sensation.</i> The first time we open our eyes we get an
optical object which is <i>a place</i>, but which is not yet <i>placed</i> in
relation to any other object, nor identified with any place
otherwise known. It is a place with which so far we are
only <i>acquainted</i>. When later we know that this same place
is in 'front' of us, that only means that we have learned
something <i>about</i> it, namely, that it is <i>congruent with that</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<i>other</i> place, called 'front,' which is given us by certain sensations
of the arm and hand or of the head and body. But
at the first moment of our optical experience, even though
we already had an acquaintance with our head, hand, and
body, we could not possibly know anything about their
relations to this new seen object. It could not be immediately
located in respect of <i>them</i>. How its place agrees with
the places which their feelings yield is a matter of which
only later experience can inform us; and in the next
chapter we shall see with some detail how later experience
does this by means of discrimination, association, selection,
and other constantly working functions of the mind. When,
therefore, the baby grasps at the moon, that does not mean
that what he sees fails to give him the sensation which he
afterwards knows as distance; it means only that he has
not learned at what <i>tactile or manual distance</i> things which appear
at that <i>visual distance</i> are.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And when a person just
operated for cataract gropes close to his face for far-off
objects, that only means the same thing. All the ordinary
optical signs of differing distances are absent from the poor
creature's sensation anyhow. His vision is monocular
(only one eye being operated at a time); the lens is gone,
and everything is out of focus; he feels photophobia, lachrymation,
and other painful resident sensations of the eyeball
itself, whose place he has long since learned to know in
tactile terms; what wonder, then, that the first tactile reaction
which the new sensations provoke should be one
associated with the tactile situation of the organ itself?
And as for his assertions about the matter, what wonder,
again, if, as Prof. Paul Janet says, they are still expressed
in the tactile language which is the only one he knows.
"<i>To be touched</i> means for him to receive an impression without
first making a movement." His eye gets such an
impression now; so he can only say that the objects are
'touching it.'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All his language, borrowed from touch, but applied to the objects
of his sight, make us think that he perceives differently from ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
whereas, at bottom, it is only his different way of talking about the same
experience."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The other cases of translocation of our sensations are
equally easily interpreted without supposing any 'projection'
from a centre at which they are originally perceived.
Unfortunately the details are intricate; and what I say now
can only be made fully clear when we come to the next
chapter. We shall then see that we are constantly selecting
certain of our sensations as <i>realities</i> and degrading
others to the status of <i>signs</i> of these. When we get one of
the signs we think of the reality signified; and the strange
thing is that then the reality (which need not be itself a
sensation at all at the time, but only an idea) is so interesting
that it acquires an hallucinatory strength, which may
even eclipse that of the relatively uninteresting sign and entirely
divert our attention from the latter. Thus the sensations
to which our joints give rise when they rotate are
signs of what, through a large number of other sensations,
tactile and optical, we have come to know as the movement
of the whole limb. This movement of the whole limb is
what we <i>think of</i> when the joint's nerves are excited in that
way; and <i>its</i> place is so much more important than the
joint's place that our sense of the latter is taken up, so to
speak, into our perception of the former, and the sensation
of the movement seems to diffuse itself into our very fingers
and toes. But by abstracting our attention from the suggestion
of the entire extremity we can perfectly well perceive
the same sensation as if it were concentrated in one
spot. We can identify it with a differently located tactile
and visual image of 'the joint' itself.</p>

<p>Just so when we feel the tip of our cane against the
ground. The peculiar sort of movement of the hand (impossible
in one direction, but free in every other) which
we experience when the tip touches 'the ground,' is a sign
to us of the visual and tactile object which we already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
know under that name. We think of 'the ground' as being
there and giving us the sensation of this kind of movement.
The sensation, we say, comes <i>from</i> the ground. The ground's
place seems to be its place; although at the same time,
and for very similar practical reasons, we think of another
optical and tactile object, 'the hand' namely, and consider
that <i>its</i> place <i>also</i> must be the place of our sensation. In
other words, we take an object or sensible content A, and
confounding it with another object otherwise known, B, or
with two objects otherwise known, B and C, we identify its
place with their places. But in all this there is <i>no 'projecting'</i>
(such as the extradition-philosophers talk of) of A out
of an <i>original</i> place; no primitive location which it first
occupied, <i>away from</i> these other sensations, has to be contradicted;
no natural 'centre,' from which it is expelled,
exists. That would imply that A aboriginally came to us
in definite local relations with other sensations, for to be
<i>out</i> of B and C is to be in local relation with them as much
as to be <i>in</i> them is so. But it was no more out of B and C
than it was in them when it first came to us. It simply
had nothing to do with them. To say that we feel a sensation's
seat to be 'in the brain' or 'against the eye' or
'under the skin' is to say as much <i>about</i> it and to deal
with it in as non-primitive a way as to say that it is a mile
off. These are all secondary perceptions, ways of defining
the sensation's seat <i>per aliud</i>. They involve numberless
associations, identifications, and imaginations, and admit a
great deal of vacillation and uncertainty in the result.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>I conclude, then, that there is no truth in the 'eccentric projection'
theory</i>. It is due to the confused assumption that
the bodily processes which cause a sensation must also be
its seat.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But sensations have no seat in this sense. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<i>become</i> seats for each other, as fast as experience associates
them together; but that violates no primitive seat possessed
by any one of them. And though our sensations cannot
then so analyze and talk of themselves, yet at their very
first appearance quite as much as at any later date are they
cognizant of all those qualities which we end by extracting
and conceiving under the names of <i>objectivity, exteriority,</i>
and <i>extent</i>. It is surely subjectivity and interiority which
are the notions <i>latest</i> acquired by the human mind.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Some persons will say that we never have a really simple object or
content. My definition of sensation does not require the simplicity to be
absolutely, but only relatively, extreme. It is worth while in passing,
however, to warn the reader against a couple of inferences that are often
made. One is that because we gradually learn to analyze so many qualities
we ought to conclude that there are no really indecomposable feelings
in the mind. The other is that because the processes that produce our sensations
are multiple, the sensations regarded as subjective facts must also
be compound. To take an example, to a child the taste of lemonade comes
at first as a simple quality. He later learns both that many stimuli and
many nerves are involved in the exhibition of this taste to his mind, and
he also learns to perceive separately the sourness, the coolness, the sweet,
the lemon aroma, etc., and the several degrees of strength of each and all
of these things,&mdash;the experience falling into a large number of aspects,
each of which is abstracted, classed, named, etc., and all of which appear
to be the elementary sensations into which the original 'lemonade flavor'
is decomposed. It is argued from this that the latter never was the simple
thing which it seemed. I have already criticised this sort of reasoning
in Chapter VI (see pp. 170 ff.). The mind of the child enjoying the simple
lemonade flavor and that of the same child grown up and analyzing it are
in two entirely different conditions. Subjectively considered, the two
states of mind are two altogether distinct sorts of fact. The later mental
state says 'this is the <i>same flavor (or fluid)</i> which that earlier state perceived
as simple,' but that does not make the two states themselves identical.
It is nothing but a case of learning more and more <i>about</i> the same topics
of discourse or things.&mdash;Many of these topics, however, must be confessed
to resist all analysis, the various colors for example. He who sees blue and
yellow 'in' a certain green means merely that when green is confronted
with these other colors he sees relations of <i>similarity</i>. He who sees abstract
'color' in it means merely that he sees a similarity between it and all the
other objects known as colors. (Similarity itself cannot ultimately be accounted
for by an identical abstract element buried in all the similars, as
has been already shown, p. 492 ff.) He who sees abstract paleness, intensity,
purity, in the green means other similarities still. These are all outward
determinations of that special green, knowledges <i>about</i> it, <i>zufällige Ansichten</i>,
as Herbart would say, not <i>elements</i> of its composition. Compare
the article by Meinong in the Vierteljahrschrift für wiss. Phil., xii. 324.</p></div>

scope. Common-sense and common psychology express this by saying
that the mental state is composed of distinct fractional <i>parts</i>, one of which
is sensation, the other conception. We, however, who believe every
mental state to be an integral thing (Vol. I. p. 276) cannot talk thus, but must
speak of the degree of sensational or intellectual character, or function, of
the mental state. Professor Hering puts, as usual, his finger better upon
the truth than any one else. Writing of visual perception, he says: "It
is inadmissible in the present state of our knowledge to assert that first
and last the same retinal picture arouses exactly the same <i>pure sensation</i>,
but that this sensation, in consequence of practice and experience, is differently
<i>interpreted</i> the last time, and elaborated into a different perception
from the first. For the only real <i>data</i> are, on the one hand, the physical
picture on the retina,&mdash;and that is both times the same; and, on the other
hand, the resultant state of consciousness (<i>ausgeloste Empfindungscomplex</i>)&mdash;and
that is both times distinct. <i>Of any third thing, namely, a pure sensation
thrust between the retinal and the mental pictures, we know nothing.
We can then, if we wish to avoid all hypothesis, only say that the nervous apparatus
reacts upon the same stimulus differently the last time from the first, and
that in consequence the consciousness is different too.</i>" (Hermann's Hdbch.,
iii. i. 567-8.)</p></div>

way, that sensations know anything. "It is evident that the lowest or
most restricted form of sensation does not contain an element of knowledge.
The mere state of mind called the sensation of scarlet is not knowledge,
although a necessary preparation for it." 'Is not knowledge <i>about</i>
scarlet' is all that Professor Bain can rightfully say.</p></div>

in consciousness at one time as there are inlets to the sense then played
upon, that it is a fundamental law of pure sensation that each momentary
state of the organism yields but one feeling, however numerous may be its
parts and its exposures.... To this original Unity of consciousness it makes
no difference that the tributaries to the single feeling are beyond the organism
instead of within it, in an outside object with several sensible properties,
instead of in the living body with its several sensitive functions....
The unity therefore is not made by 'association' of several components;
but the plurality is formed by <i>dissociation</i> of unsuspected varieties within
the unity; the substantive thing being no product of synthesis, but the
residuum of differentiation." (J. Martineau: A Study of Religion (1888),

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Such passages as the following abound in anti-sensationalist literature:
"Sense is a kind of dull, confused, and stupid perception obtruded upon
the soul from without, whereby it perceives the alterations and motions
within its own body, and takes cognizance of individual bodies existing
round about it, but does not clearly comprehend what they are nor penetrate
into the nature of them, it being intended by nature, as Plotinus speaks,
not so properly for <i>knowledge</i> as for the <i>use of the body</i>. For the soul suffering
under that which it perceives by way of <i>passion</i> cannot master or
<i>Conquer</i> it, that is to say, know or understand it. For so Anaxagoras in Aristotle
very fitly expresses the nature of knowledge and intellection under
the notion of <i>Conquering</i>. Wherefore it is necessary, since the mind understands
all things, that it should be free from mixture and passion, for this
end, as Anaxagoras speaks, that it may be able to <i>master and conquer</i> its
objects, that is to say, to <i>know and understand</i> them. In like manner Plotinus,
in his book of Sense and Memory, makes to <i>suffer</i> and to <i>be conquered</i>
all one, as also to <i>know</i> and to <i>conquer</i>; for which reason he concludes that
that which suffers doth not know.... Sense that suffers from external
objects lies as it were prostrate under them, and is overcome by them....
Sense therefore is a certain kind of drowsy and somnolent perception
of that passive part of the soul which is as it were asleep in the body,
and acts concretely with it.... It is an energy arising from the body and
a certain kind of drowsy or sleeping life of the soul blended together
with it. The perceptions of which compound, or of the soul as it were half
asleep and half awake, are confused, indistinct, turbid, and encumbered
cogitations very different from the energies of the noetical part,... which
are free, clear, serene, satisfactory, and awakened cogitations. That is to
say, knowledges." Etc., etc., etc. (R. Cudworth: Treatise concerning
Eternal and Immutable Morality, bk. iii. chap. ii.) Similarly Malebranche:
"<span class="smcap">Théodore</span>.&mdash;Oh, oh, Ariste! God knows pain, pleasure, warmth,
and the rest. But he does not feel these things. He knows pain, since he
knows what that modification of the soul is in which pain consists. He
knows it because he alone causes it in us (as I shall presently prove), and he
knows what he does. In a word, he knows it because his knowledge has
no bounds. But he does not feel it, for if so he would be unhappy. To
know pain, then, is not to feel it. <span class="smcap">Ariste</span>.&mdash;That is true. But to feel it
is to know it, is it not? <span class="smcap">Théodore</span>.&mdash;No indeed, since God does not feel
it in the least, and yet he knows it perfectly. But in order not to quibble
about terms, if you will have it that to feel pain is to know it, agree at least
that it is not to know it clearly, that it is not to know it by light and by
evidence&mdash;in a word, that it is not to know its nature; in other words and to
speak exactly, it is not to know it at all. To feel pain, for example, is to
feel ourselves unhappy without well knowing either what we are or what
is this modality of our being which makes us unhappy.... Impose silence
on your senses, your imagination, and your passions, and you will hear the
pure voice of inner truth, the clear and evident replies of our common master.
Never confound the evidence which results from the comparison of
ideas with the liveliness of the sensations which touch and thrill you. The
livelier our sensations and feelings (<i>sentiments</i>) are, the more darkness do
they shed. The more terrible or agreeable are our phantoms, and the more
body and reality they appear to have, the more dangerous are they and fit
to lead us astray." (Entretiens sur la Métaphysique, 3me Entretien, <i>ad
init.</i>) Malebranche's Théodore prudently does not try to explain how
God's 'infinite felicity' is compatible with his not feeling joy.</p></div>

human being but strenuously feeble writer means by relation. Sometimes
it seems to stand for system of related fact. The ubiquity of the
'psychologist's fallacy' (see Vol. I p. 196) in his pages, his incessant leaning on
the confusion between the thing known, the thought that knows it, and the
farther things known about that thing and about that thought by later and
additional thoughts, make it impossible to clear up his meaning. Compare,
however, with the utterances in the text such others as these: "The waking
of Self-consciousness from the sleep of sense is an absolute new beginning,
and nothing can come within the 'crystal sphere' of intelligence
except as it is determined by intelligence. What sense is to sense is nothing
for thought. What sense is to thought, it is as determined <i>by</i> thought.
There can, therefore, be no 'reality' in sensation to which the world of
thought can be referred." (Edward Caird's Philosophy of Kant, 1st ed.
pp. 393-4.) "When," says Green again, "feeling a pain or pleasure of
heat, I perceive it to be connected with the action of approaching the fire,
am I not perceiving a relation <i>of which one constituent, at any rate, is a
simple sensation? The true answer is, No.</i>" "Perception, in its simplest
form...&mdash;perception as the first sight or touch of an object in which
nothing but what is seen or touched is recognized&mdash;<i>neither is nor contains
sensation</i>" (Contemp. Rev., xxxi. pp. 746, 750.) "Mere sensation is in
truth a phrase that represents no reality." "Mere feeling, then, as a matter
unformed by thought, has no place in the world of facts, in the cosmos
of possible experience." (Prolegomena to Ethics, §§ 46, 50.)&mdash;I have expressed
myself a little more fully on this subject in Mind, x. 27 ff.</p></div>

presented by the temperature-sense (see W. Preyer in Archiv f. d. ges.
Phys., Bd. xxv. p. 79 ff.). Successive contrast here is shown in the fact
that a warm sensation appears warmer if a cold one has just previously
been experienced; and a cold one colder, if the preceding one was warm.
If a finger which has been plunged in hot water, and another which has
been in cold water, be both immersed in lukewarm water, the same water
appears cold to the former finger and warm to the latter. In simultaneous
contrast, a sensation of warmth on any part of the skin tends to induce the
sensation of cold in its immediate neighborhood; and <i>vice versâ</i>. This
may be seen if we press with the palm on two metal surfaces of about an
inch and a half square and three-fourths inch apart; the skin between them
appears distinctly warmer. So also a small object of exactly the temperature
of the palm appears warm if a cold object, and cold if a warm object,
touch the skin near it.</p></div>

(found on p. 24 ff.) may be cited as a typical one: "From dark
gray paper cut two strips 3-4 cm. long and 1/2 cm. wide, and lay them on a
background of which one half is white and the other half deep black, in
such a way that one strip lies on each side of the border-line and parallel
to it, and at least 1 cm. distant from it. Fixate 1/2 to 1 minute a point on
the border-line between the strips. One strip appears much brighter than
the other. Close and cover the eyes, and the negative after-image appears....
The difference in brightness of the strips in the after-image is in general
much greater than it appeared in direct vision.... This difference
in brightness of the strips by no means always increases and decreases with
the difference in brightness of the two halves of the background.... A
phase occurs in which the difference in brightness of the two halves of
the background entirely disappears, and yet both after-images of the strips
are still very clear, one of them brighter and one darker than the background,
which is equally bright on both halves. Here can no longer be
any question of contrast-effect, because the <i>conditio sine quâ non</i> of contrast,
namely, the differing brightness of the ground, is no longer present.
This proves that the different brightness of the after-images of the
strips must have its ground in a different state of excitation of the corresponding
portions of the retina, and from this follows further that both
these portions of the retina were differently stimulated during the original
observation; for the different after-effect demands here a different fore-effect....
In the original arrangement, the objectively similar strips
appeared of different brightness, because both corresponding portions of
the retina were truly differently excited."</p></div>

statements as these: "The consequence is that when a sensation has for
its usual condition the presence of an object more or less distant from our
bodies, and experience has once made us acquainted with this distance, we
shall situate our sensation at this distance.&mdash;This, in fact, is the case
with sensations of hearing and sight. The peripheral extremity of the
acoustic nerve is in the deep-seated chamber of the ear. That of the
optic nerve is in the most inner recess of the eye. But still, in our
present state, we never situate our sensations of sound or color in these
places, but without us, and often at a considerable distance from us....
All our sensations of color are thus projected out of our body, and clothe
more or less distant objects, furniture, walls, houses, trees, the sky, and the
rest. This is why, when we afterwards reflect on them, we cease to attribute
them to ourselves; they are alienated and detached from us, so far
as to appear different from us. Projected from the nervous surface in
which we localize the majority of the others, the tie which connected
them to the others and to ourselves is undone.... Thus, all our sensations
are wrongly situated, and the red color is no more extended on the
arm-chair than the sensation of tingling is situated at my fingers' ends.
They are all situated in the sensory centres of the encephalon; all appear
situated elsewhere, and a common law allots to each of them its apparent
situation." (vol. ii. pp. 47-53.)&mdash;Similarly Schopenhauer: "I will now
show the same by the sense of sight. The immediate <i>datum</i> is here
limited to the sensation of the retina which, it is true, admits of considerable
diversity, but at bottom reverts to the impression of light
and dark with their shades, and that of colors. This sensation is
through and through subjective, that is, inside of the organism and
under the skin." (Schopenhauer: Satz vom Grunde, p. 58.) This philosopher
then enumerates <i>seriatim</i> what the Intellect does to make the originally
subjective sensation objective: 1) it turns it bottom side up; 2) it
reduces its doubleness to singleness; 3) it changes its flatness to solidity; and
4) it projects it to a distance from the eye. Again: "<i>Sensations</i> are
what we call the impressions on our senses, in so far as they come to our
consciousness as states of our own body, especially of our nervous
apparatus; we call them <i>perceptions</i> when we form out of them the representation
of outer objects." (Helmholtz: Tonempfindungen, 1870, p. 101.)&mdash;Once
more: "Sensation is always accomplished in the psychic centres,
but it manifests itself at the excited part of the periphery. In other words,
one is conscious of the phenomenon in the nervous centres,... but one
perceives it in the peripheric organs. This phenomenon depends on the
experience of the sensations themselves, in which there is a <i>reflection</i> of
the subjective phenomenon and a tendency on the part of perception to
return as it were to the external cause which has roused the mental state
because the latter is connected with the former." (Sergi: Psychologie
Physiologique (Paris, 1888), p. 189.)&mdash;The clearest and best passage I know
is in Liebmann: Der Objective Anblick (1869), pp. 67-72, but it is unfortunately
too long to quote.</p></div>

comes, of how, with an upside-down picture on the retina, we can see
things right-side up. Our consciousness is <i>naïvely</i> supposed to inhabit the
picture and to feel the picture's position as related to other objects of space.
But the truth is that the picture is non-existent either as a habitat or as anything
else, for immediate consciousness. Our notion of it is an enormously
late conception. The outer object is given immediately with all those
qualities which later are named and determined in relation to other sensations.
The 'bottom' of this object is where we see what by touch we
afterwards know as our <i>feet</i>, the 'top' is the place in which we see what
we know as other people's heads, etc., etc. Berkeley long ago made this
matter perfectly clear (see his Essay towards a new Theory of Vision,
§§ 93-98, 113-118).</p></div>

object, against the summary account given now, that in a babe's immediate
field of vision the various things which appear are located <i>relatively to each
other</i> from the outset. I admit that <i>if discriminated</i>, they would appear so
located. But they are parts of the content of one sensation, not sensations
separately experienced, such as the text is concerned with. The fully developed
'world,' in which all our sensations ultimately find location, is
nothing but an imaginary object framed after the pattern of the field of
vision, by the addition and continuation of one sensation upon another in
an orderly and systematic way. In corroboration of my text I must refer

<h4>IMAGINATION.</h4>


<p><i>Sensations, once experienced, modify the nervous organism,
so that copies of them arise again in the mind after the original
outward stimulus is gone.</i> No mental copy, however,
can arise in the mind, of any kind of sensation which has
never been directly excited from without.</p>

<p>The blind may dream of sights, the deaf of sounds,
for years after they have lost their vision or hearing;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> but
the man <i>born</i> deaf can never be made to imagine what sound
is like, nor can the man <i>born</i> blind ever have a mental
vision. In Locke's words, already quoted, "the mind can
frame unto itself no one new simple idea." The originals
of them all must have been given from without. Fantasy, or
Imagination, are the names given to the faculty of reproducing
copies of originals once felt. The imagination is
called 'reproductive' when the copies are literal; 'productive'
when elements from different originals are recombined
so as to make new wholes.</p>

<p><i>After-images</i> belong to sensation rather than to imagination;
so that the most immediate phenomena of imagination
would seem to be those tardier images (due to what
the Germans call <i>Sinnesgedächtniss</i>) which were spoken of
in Vol. I, p. 617,&mdash;coercive hauntings of the mind by echoes
of unusual experiences for hours after the latter have taken
place. The phenomena ordinarily ascribed to imagination,
however, are those mental pictures of possible sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
experiences, to which the ordinary processes of associative
thought give rise.</p>

<p>When represented with surroundings concrete enough
to constitute a <i>date</i>, these pictures, when they revive, form
<i>recollections</i>. We have already studied the machinery of
recollection in Chapter XVI. When the mental pictures
are of data freely combined, and reproducing no past combination
exactly, we have acts of imagination properly
so called.</p>


<h4>OUR IMAGES ARE USUALLY VAGUE.</h4>


<p>For the ordinary 'analytic' psychology, each sensibly
discernible element of the object imagined is represented
by its own separate idea, and the total object
is imagined by a 'cluster' or 'gang' of ideas. We have
seen abundant reason to reject this view (see Vol. I, p. 276 ff.). An
imagined object, however complex, is at any one moment
thought in one idea, which is aware of all its qualities together.
If I slip into the ordinary way of talking, and
speak of various ideas 'combining,' the reader will understand
that this is only for popularity and convenience, and
he will not construe it into a concession to the atomistic
theory in psychology.</p>

<p>Hume was the hero of the atomistic theory. Not only
were ideas copies of original impressions made on the sense-organs,
but they were, according to him, completely adequate
copies, and were all so separate from each other as
to possess no manner of connection. Hume proves ideas
in the imagination to be completely adequate copies, not
by appeal to observation, but by <i>a priori</i> reasoning, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The mind cannot form any notion of quantity or quality, without
forming a precise notion of the degrees of each," for "'tis confessed
that no object can appear to the senses; or in other words, that no impression<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
can become present to the mind, without being determined in
its degrees both of quantity and quality. The confusion in which impressions
are sometimes involved proceeds only from their faintness
and unsteadiness, not from any capacity in the mind to receive any impression,
which in its real existence has no particular degree nor proportion.
That is a contradiction in terms; and even implies the flattest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of all contradictions, <i>viz.</i>, that 'tis possible for the same thing both to
be and not to be. Now since all ideas are derived from impressions,
and are nothing but copies and representations of them, whatever is
true of the one must be acknowledged concerning the other. Impressions
and ideas differ only in their strength and vivacity. The foregoing
conclusion is not founded on any particular degree of vivacity. It
cannot therefore be affected by any variation in that particular. An
idea is a weaker impression; and as a strong impression must necessarily
have a determinate quantity and quality, the case must be the
same with its copy or representative."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The slightest introspective glance will show to anyone
the falsity of this opinion. Hume surely had images of
his own works without seeing distinctly every word and
letter upon the pages which floated before his mind's eye.
His dictum is therefore an exquisite example of the way in
which a man will be blinded by <i>a priori</i> theories to the
most flagrant facts. It is a rather remarkable thing, too,
that the psychologists of Hume's own empiricist school
have, as a rule, been more guilty of this blindness than
their opponents. The fundamental <i>facts</i> of consciousness
have been, on the whole, more accurately reported by the
spiritualistic writers. None of Hume's pupils, so far as I
know, until Taine and Huxley, ever took the pains to contradict
the opinion of their master. Prof. Huxley in his
brilliant little work on Hume set the matter straight in the
following words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When complex impressions or complex ideas are reproduced as
memories, it is probable that the copies never give all the details of the
originals with perfect accuracy, and it is certain that they rarely do so.
No one possesses a memory so good, that if he has only once observed
a natural object, a second inspection does not show him something that
he has forgotten. Almost all, if not all, our memories are therefore
sketches, rather than portraits, of the originals&mdash;the salient features
are obvious, while the subordinate characters are obscure or unrepresented.</p>

<p>"Now, when several complex impressions which are more or less
different from one another&mdash;let us say that out of ten impressions in
each, six are the same in all, and four are different from all the rest&mdash;are
successively presented to the mind, it is easy to see what must be
the nature of the result. The repetition of the six similar impressions
will strengthen the six corresponding elements of the complex idea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
which will therefore acquire greater vividness; while the four differing
impressions of each will not only acquire no greater strength than they
had at first, but, in accordance with the law of association, they will
all tend to appear at once, and will thus neutralize one another.</p>

<p>"This mental operation may be rendered comprehensible by considering
what takes place in the formation of compound photographs&mdash;when
the images of the faces of six sitters, for example, are each received
on the same photographic plate, for a sixth of the time requisite
to take one portrait. The final result is that all those points in which
the six faces agree are brought out strongly, while all those in which
they differ are left vague; and thus what may be termed a <i>generic</i> portrait
of the six, in contradistinction to a <i>specific</i> portrait of any one, is
produced.</p>

<p>"Thus our ideas of single complex impressions are incomplete in
one way, and those of numerous, more or less similar, complex impressions
are incomplete in another way; that is to say, they are <i>generic</i>,
not <i>specific</i>. And hence it follows that our ideas of the impressions
in question are not, in the strict sense of the word, copies of those
impressions; while, at the same time, they may exist in the mind independently
of language.</p>

<p>"The generic ideas which are formed from several similar, but not
identical, complex experiences are what are called <i>abstract</i> or <i>general</i>
ideas; and Berkeley endeavored to prove that all general ideas are
nothing but particular ideas annexed to a certain term, which gives
them a more extensive signification, and makes them recall, upon occasion,
other individuals which are similar to them. Hume says that
he regards this as 'one of the greatest and the most valuable discoveries
that has been made of late years in the republic of letters,' and endeavors
to confirm it in such a manner that it shall be 'put beyond
all doubt and controversy.'</p>

<p>"I may venture to express a doubt whether he has succeeded in his
object; but the subject is an abstruse one; and I must content myself
with the remark, that though Berkeley's view appears to be largely
applicable to such general ideas as are formed after language has been
acquired, and to all the more abstract sort of conceptions, yet that general
ideas of sensible objects may nevertheless be produced in the way
indicated, and may exist independently of language. In dreams, one
sees houses, trees, and other objects, which are perfectly recognizable as
such, but which remind one of the actual objects as seen 'out of the
corner of the eye,' or of the pictures thrown by a badly-focussed magic
lantern. A man addresses us who is like a figure seen in twilight; or
we travel through countries where every feature of the scenery is vague;
the outlines of the hills are ill-marked, and the rivers have no defined
banks. They are, in short, generic ideas of many past impressions of
men, hills, and rivers. An anatomist who occupies himself intently
with the examination of several specimens of some new kind of animal,
in course of time acquires so vivid a conception of its form and structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
that the idea may take visible shape and become a sort of waking
dream. But the figure which thus presents itself is generic, not specific.
It is no copy of any one specimen, but, more or less, a mean of
the series; and there seems no reason to doubt that the minds of children
before they learn to speak, and of deaf-mutes, are peopled with
similarly generated generic ideas of sensible objects."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p></blockquote>

<h4><i>Are Vague Images 'Abstract Ideas'?</i></h4>


<p>The only point which I am tempted to criticise in this
account is Prof. Huxley's <i>identification of these generic images
with 'abstract or general ideas' in the sense of universal conceptions.</i>
Taine gives the truer view. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some years ago I saw in England, in Kew Gardens, for the first
time, araucarias, and I walked along the beds looking at these strange
plants, with their rigid bark and compact, short, scaly leaves, of a
sombre green, whose abrupt, rough, bristling form cut in upon the fine
softly-lighted turf of the fresh grass-plat. If I now inquire what this
experience has left in me, I find, first, the sensible representation of an
araucaria; in fact, I have been able to describe almost exactly the form
and color of the plant. But there is a difference between this representation
and the former sensations, of which it is the present echo. The
internal semblance, from which I have just made my description, is
vague, and my past sensations were precise. For, assuredly, each of
the araucarias I saw then excited in me a distinct visual sensation;
there are no two absolutely similar plants in nature; I observed perhaps
twenty or thirty araucarias; without a doubt each one of them differed
from the others in size, in girth, by the more or less obtuse angles of its
branches, by the more or less abrupt jutting out of its scales, by the style
of its texture; consequently, my twenty or thirty visual sensations were
different. But no one of these sensations has completely survived in its
echo; the twenty or thirty revivals have blunted one another; thus
upset and agglutinated by their resemblance they are confounded
together, and my present representation is their residue only. This is
the product, or rather the fragment, which is deposited in us, when we
have gone through a series of similar facts or individuals. Of our
numerous experiences there remain on the following day four or five
more or less distinct recollections, which, obliterated themselves, leave
behind in us a simple colorless, vague representation, into which enter
as components various reviving sensations, in an utterly feeble, incomplete,
and abortive state.&mdash;<i>But this representation is not the general and
abstract idea. It is but its accompaniment,</i> and, if I may say so, the
ore from which it is extracted. For the representation, though badly
sketched, is a sketch, the sensible sketch of a distinct individual....
But my abstract idea corresponds to the whole class; it differs, then,
from the representation of an individual.&mdash;Moreover, my abstract idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
is perfectly clear and determinate; now that I possess it, I never fail
to recognize an araucaria among the various plants which may be shown
me; it differs then from the confused and floating representation I have
of some particular araucaria."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, a blurred picture is just as much a single
mental fact as a sharp picture is; and <i>the use of either picture
by the mind to symbolize a whole class of individuals is a new
mental function,</i> requiring some other modification of consciousness
than the mere perception that the picture is
distinct or not. I may bewail the indistinctness of my
mental image of my absent friend. That does not prevent
my thought from meaning <i>him</i> alone, however. And I may
mean all mankind, with perhaps a very sharp image of one
man in my mind's eye. The meaning is a function of the
more 'transitive' parts of consciousness, the 'fringe' of
relations which we feel surrounding the image, be the latter
sharp or dim. This was explained in a previous place (see Vol. I,
p. 473 ff., especially the note to page 477), and I would not
touch upon the matter at all here but for its historical
interest.</p>

<p>Our ideas or images of past sensible experiences may
then be either distinct and adequate or dim, blurred, and
incomplete. It is likely that the different degrees in which
different men are able to make them sharp and complete
has had something to do with keeping up such philosophic
disputes as that of Berkeley with Locke over abstract ideas.
Locke had spoken of our possessing 'the general idea of a
triangle' which "must be neither oblique nor rectangle,
neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but all and
none of these at once." Berkeley says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If any man has the faculty of framing in his mind such an idea of
a triangle as is here described, it is in vain to pretend to dispute him
out of it, nor would I go about it. All I desire is that the reader would
fully and certainly inform himself whether <i>he</i> has such an idea or no."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Until very recent years it was supposed by all philosophers
that there was a typical human mind which all individual
minds were like, and that propositions of universal
validity could be laid down about such faculties as 'the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Imagination.' Lately, however, a mass of revelations have
poured in, which make us see how false a view this is.
There are imaginations, not 'the Imagination,' and they
must be studied in detail.</p>


<h4>INDIVIDUALS DIFFER IN IMAGINATION.</h4>


<p>The first breaker of ground in this direction was Fechner,
in 1860. Fechner was gifted with unusual talent for subjective
observation, and in chapter xliv of his 'Psychophysik'
he gave the results of a most careful comparison of his
own optical after-images, with his optical memory-pictures,
together with accounts by several other individuals of their
optical memory-pictures.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The result was to show a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
personal diversity. "It would be interesting," he writes,
"to work up the subject statistically; and I regret that
other occupations have kept me from fulfilling my earlier
intention to proceed in this way."</p>

<p>Flechner's intention was independently executed by Mr.
Galton, the publication of whose results in 1880 may be
said to have made an era in descriptive Psychology.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not necessary," says Galton, "to trouble the reader with my
early tentative steps. After the inquiry had been fairly started it took
the form of submitting a certain number of printed questions to a large
number of persons. There is hardly any more difficult task than that
of framing questions which are not likely to be misunderstood, which
admit of easy reply, and which cover the ground of inquiry. I did my
best in these respects, without forgetting the most important part of
all&mdash;namely, to tempt my correspondents to write freely in fuller explanation
of their replies, and on cognate topics as well. These separate
letters have proved more instructive and interesting by far than the
replies to the set questions.</p>

<p>"The first group of the rather long series of queries related to the
illumination, definition, and coloring of the mental image, and were
framed thus:</p>

<p>"'Before addressing yourself to any of the Questions on the opposite
page, think of some definite object&mdash;suppose it is your breakfast-table
as you sat down to it this morning&mdash;and consider carefully the picture
that rises before your mind's eye.</p>

<p>"'1. <i>Illumination.</i>&mdash;Is the image dim or fairly clear? Is its brightness
comparable to that of the actual scene?</p>

<p>"'2. <i>Definition.</i>&mdash;Are all the objects pretty well defined at the same
time, or is the place of sharpest definition at any one moment more contracted
than it is in a real scene?</p>

<p>"'3. <i>Coloring.</i>&mdash;Are the colors of the china, of the toast, bread-crust,
mustard, meat, parsley, or whatever may have been on the table, quite
distinct and natural?'</p>

<p>"The earliest results of my inquiry amazed me. I had begun by
questioning friends in the scientific world, as they were the most likely
class of men to give accurate answers concerning this faculty of visualizing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to which novelists and poets continually allude, which has left
an abiding mark on the vocabularies of every language, and which
supplies the material out of which dreams and the well-known hallucinations
of sick people are built.</p>

<p>"To my astonishment, I found that <i>the great majority of the men
of science to whom I first applied protested that mental imagery was
unknown to them,</i> and they looked on me as fanciful and fantastic in
supposing that the words 'mental imagery' really expressed what I
believed everybody supposed them to mean. They had no more notion
of its true nature than a color-blind man, who has not discerned his
defect, has of the nature of color. They had a mental deficiency of
which they were unaware, and naturally enough supposed that those
who affirmed they possessed it were romancing. To illustrate their
mental attitude it will be sufficient to quote a few lines from the letter
of one of my correspondents, who writes:</p>

<p>"'These questions presuppose assent to some sort of a proposition regarding
the "mind's eye," and the "images" which it sees.... This
points to some initial fallacy.... It is only by a figure of speech that
I can describe my recollection of a scene as a "mental image" which
I can "see" with my "mind's eye."... I do not see it... any more
than a man sees the thousand lines of Sophocles which under due
pressure he is ready to repeat. The memory possesses it,' etc.</p>

<p>"Much the same result followed inquiries made for me by a friend
among members of the French Institute.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, when I spoke to persons whom I met <i>in general
society</i>, I found an entirely different disposition to prevail. <i>Many
men and a yet larger number of women, and many boys and girls,
declared that they habitually saw mental imagery, and that it was
perfectly distinct to them and full of color.</i> The more I pressed and
crossed-questioned them, professing myself to be incredulous, the more
obvious was the truth of their first assertions. They described
their imagery in minute detail, and they spoke in a tone of surprise at
my apparent hesitation in accepting what they said. I felt that I myself
should have spoken exactly as they did if I had been describing a
scene that lay before my eyes, in broad daylight, to a blind man who
persisted in doubting the reality of vision. Reassured by this happier
experience, I recommenced to inquire among scientific men, and soon
found scattered instances of what I sought, though in by no means the
same abundance as elsewhere. I then circulated my questions more
generally among my friends and through their hands, and obtained replies... from
persons of both sexes, and of various ages, and in the
end from occasional correspondents in nearly every civilized country.</p>

<p>"I have also received batches of answers from various educational
establishments both in England and America, which were made after
the masters had fully explained the meaning of the questions, and interested
the boys in them. These have the merit of returns derived
from a general census, which my other data lack, because I cannot for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
a moment suppose that the writers of the latter are a haphazard proportion
of those to whom they were sent. Indeed I know of some who,
disavowing all possession of the power, and of many others who, possessing
it in too faint a degree to enable them to express what their
experiences really were, in a manner satisfactory to themselves, sent no
returns at all. Considerable statistical similarity was, however, observed
between the sets of returns furnished by the schoolboys and
those sent by my separate correspondents, and I may add that they accord
in this respect with the oral information I have elsewhere obtained.
The conformity of replies from so many different sources which was
clear from the first, the fact of their apparent trustworthiness being on
the whole much increased by cross-examination (though I could give
one or two amusing instances of break-down), and the evident effort
made to give accurate answers, have convinced me that it is a much
easier matter than I had anticipated to obtain trustworthy replies to
psychological questions. Many persons, especially women and intelligent
children, take pleasure in introspection, and strive their very best
to explain their mental processes. I think that a delight in self-dissection
must be a strong ingredient in the pleasure that many are said to
take in confessing themselves to priests.</p>

<p>"Here, then, are two rather notable results: the one is the proved
facility of obtaining statistical insight into the processes of other persons'
minds, whatever <i>a priori</i> objection may have been made as to its
possibility; and the other is that scientific men, as a class, have feeble
powers of visual representation. There is no doubt whatever on the
latter point, however it may be accounted for. My own conclusion is
that an over-ready perception of sharp mental pictures is antagonistic
to the acquirement of habits of highly-generalized and abstract thought,
especially when the steps of reasoning are carried on by words as
symbols, and that if the faculty of seeing the pictures was ever possessed
by men who think hard, it is very apt to be lost by disuse. The highest
minds are probably those in which it is not lost, but subordinated, and
is ready for use on suitable occasions. I am, however, bound to say
that the missing faculty seems to be replaced so serviceably by other
modes of conception, chiefly, I believe, connected with the incipient
motor sense, not of the eyeballs only but of the muscles generally, that
<i>men who declare themselves entirely deficient in the power of seeing
mental pictures can nevertheless give lifelike descriptions</i> of what they
have seen, and can otherwise express themselves as if they were gifted
with a vivid visual imagination. <i>They can also become painters of the
rank of Royal Academicians....</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is a mistake to suppose that sharp sight is accompanied by clear
visual memory. I have not a few instances in which the independence
of the two faculties is emphatically commented on; and I have at least
one clear case where great interest in outlines and accurate appreciation
of straightness, squareness, and the like, is unaccompanied by the
power of visualizing. Neither does the faculty go with dreaming. I
have cases where it is powerful, and at the same time where dreams
are rare and faint or altogether absent. One friend tells me that his
dreams have not the hundredth part of the vigor of his waking fancies.</p>

<p>"The visualizing and the identifying powers are by no means necessarily
combined. A distinguished writer on metaphysical topics assures
me that he is exceptionally quick at recognizing a face that he
has seen before, but that he cannot call up a mental image of any face
with clearness.</p>

<p>"Some persons have the power of combining in a single perception
more than can be seen at any one moment by the two eyes....</p>

<p>"I find that a few persons can, by what they often describe as a
kind of touch-sight, visualize at the same moment all round the image
of a solid body. Many can do so nearly, but not altogether round that
of a terrestrial globe. An eminent mineralogist assures me that he is
able to imagine simultaneously all the sides of a crystal with which he
is familiar. I may be allowed to quote a curious faculty of my own in
respect to this. It is exercised only occasionally and in dreams, or
rather in nightmares, but under those circumstances I am perfectly
conscious of embracing an entire sphere in a single perception. It appears
to lie within my mental eyeball, and to be viewed centripetally.</p>

<p>"This power of comprehension is practically attained in many cases
by indirect methods. It is a common feat to take in the whole surroundings
of an imagined room with such a rapid mental sweep as to
leave some doubt whether it has not been viewed simultaneously. Some
persons have the habit of viewing objects as though they were partly
transparent; thus, if they so dispose a globe in their imagination as to
see both its north and south poles at the same time, they will not be
able to see its equatorial parts. They can also perceive all the rooms of
an imaginary house by a single mental glance, the walls and floors being
as if made of glass. A fourth class of persons have the habit of recalling
scenes, not from the point of view whence they were observed, but
from a distance, and they visualize their own selves as actors on the
mental stage. By one or other of these ways, the power of seeing the
whole of an object, and not merely one aspect of it, is possessed by
many persons.</p>

<p>"The place where the image appears to lie differs much. Most persons
see it in an indefinable sort of way, others see it in front of the eye,
others at a distance corresponding to reality. There exists a power
which is rare naturally, but can, I believe, be acquired without much
difficulty, of projecting a mental picture upon a piece of paper, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
holding it fast there, so that it can be outlined with a pencil. To this
I shall recur.</p>

<p>"Images usually do not become stronger by dwelling on them; the
first idea is commonly the most vigorous, but this is not always the case.
Sometimes the mental view of a locality is inseparably connected with
the sense of its position as regards the points of the compass, real or
imaginary. I have received full and curious descriptions from very
different sources of this strong geographical tendency, and in one or
two cases I have reason to think it allied to a considerable faculty of
geographical comprehension.</p>

<p>"The power of visualizing is higher in the female sex than in the male,
and is somewhat, but not much, higher in public-school boys than in
men. After maturity is reached, the further advance of age does not
seem to dim the faculty, but rather the reverse, judging from numerous
statements to that effect; but advancing years are sometimes accompanied
by a growing habit of hard abstract thinking, and in these cases&mdash;not
uncommon among those whom I have questioned&mdash;the faculty
undoubtedly becomes impaired. There is reason to believe that it is very
high in some young children, who seem to spend years of difficulty in
distinguishing between the subjective and objective world. Language
and book-learning certainly tend to dull it.</p>

<p>"The visualizing faculty is a natural gift, and, like all natural gifts,
has a tendency to be inherited. In this faculty the tendency to inheritance
is exceptionally strong, as I have abundant evidence to prove,
especially in respect to certain rather rare peculiarities,... which,
when they exist at all, are usually found among two, three, or more
brothers and sisters, parents, children, uncles and aunts, and cousins.</p>

<p>"Since families differ so much in respect to this gift, we may suppose
that races would also differ, and there can be no doubt that such is the
case. I hardly like to refer to civilized nations, because their natural
faculties are too much modified by education to allow of their being
appraised in an off-hand fashion. I may, however, speak of the French,
who appear to possess the visualizing faculty in a high degree. The
peculiar ability they show in prearranging ceremonials and <i>fêtes</i> of all
kinds, and their undoubted genius for tactics and strategy, show that
they are able to foresee effects with unusual clearness. Their ingenuity
in all technical contrivances is an additional testimony in the same direction,
and so is their singular clearness of expression. Their phrase
'figurez-vous,' or 'picture to yourself,' seems to express their dominant
mode of perception. Our equivalent of 'imagine' is ambiguous.</p>

playing the pianoforte, or manuscript when they are making speeches.

which he has at times is due to his being plagued by the image of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
manuscript speech with its original erasures and corrections. He cannot
lay the ghost, and he puzzles in trying to decipher it.</p>

<p>"Some few persons see mentally in print every word that is uttered;
they attend to the visual equivalent and not to the sound of the words,
and they read them off usually as from a long imaginary strip of paper,
such as is unwound from telegraphic instruments."</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader will find further details in Mr. Galton's
'Inquiries into Human Faculty,' pp. 83-114.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> I have
myself for many years collected from each and all of my
psychology-students descriptions of their own visual
imagination; and found (together with some curious idiosyncrasies)
corroboration of all the variations which Mr.
Galton reports. As examples, I subjoin extracts from two
cases near the ends of the scale. The writers are first cousins,
grandsons of a distinguished man of science. The one
who is a good visualizer says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This morning's breakfast-table is both dim and bright; it is dim if
I try to think of it when my eyes are open upon any object; it is perfectly
clear and bright if I think of it with my eyes closed.&mdash;All the
objects are clear at once, yet when I confine my attention to any one
object it becomes far more distinct.&mdash;I have more power to recall color
than any other one thing: if, for example, I were to recall a plate decorated
with flowers I could reproduce in a drawing the exact tone, etc.
The color of anything that was on the table is perfectly vivid.&mdash;There
is very little limitation to the extent of my images: I can see all four
sides of a room, I can see all four sides of two, three, four, even more
rooms with such distinctness that if you should ask me what was in any
particular place in any one, or ask me to count the chairs, etc., I could
do it without the least hesitation.&mdash;The more I learn by heart the more
clearly do I see images of my pages. Even before I can recite the lines
I see them so that I could give them very slowly word for word, but
my mind is so occupied in looking at my printed image that I have no
idea of what I am saying, of the sense of it, etc. When I first found
myself doing this I used to think it was merely because I knew the lines
imperfectly; but I have quite convinced myself that I really do see an
image. The strongest proof that such is really the fact is, I think, the
following:</p>

<p>"I can look down the mentally seen page and see the words that
<i>commence</i> all the lines, and from any one of these words I can continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the line. I find this much easier to do if the words begin in a straight
line than if there are breaks. Example:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Étant fait....</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Tous....</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>A des....</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Que fit....</i></span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Comme....</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>La Fontaine</i> 8. iv.)"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The poor visualizer says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My ability to form mental images seems, from what I have studied
of other people's images, to be defective, and somewhat peculiar. The
process by which I seem to remember any particular event is not by a
series of distinct images, but a sort of panorama, the faintest impressions
of which are perceptible through a thick fog.&mdash;I cannot shut my
eyes and get a distinct image of anyone, although I used to be able to a
few years ago, and the faculty seems to have gradually slipped away.&mdash;In
my most vivid dreams, where the events appear like the most real
facts, I am often troubled with a dimness of sight which causes the
images to appear indistinct.&mdash;To come to the question of the breakfast-table,
there is nothing definite about it. Everything is vague. I cannot
say <i>what</i> I see. I could not possibly count the chairs, but I happen
to know that there are ten. I see nothing in detail.&mdash;The chief thing is a
general impression that I cannot tell exactly what I do see. The coloring
is about the same, as far as I can recall it, only very much washed
out. Perhaps the only color I can see at all distinctly is that of the table-cloth,
and I could probably see the color of the wall-paper if I could
remember what color it was."</p></blockquote>

<p>A person whose visual imagination is strong finds it
hard to understand how those who are without the faculty
can think at all. <i>Some people undoubtedly have no visual
images at all worthy of the name,</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and instead of <i>seeing</i> their
breakfast-table, they tell you that they <i>remember</i> it or <i>know</i>
what was on it. This knowing and remembering takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
place undoubtedly by means of verbal images, as was explained
already in Chapter IX, pp. 265-6.</p>

<p><i>The study of Aphasia</i> (see Vol. I, p. 54) <i>has of late years shown
how unexpectedly great are the differences between individuals in
respect of imagination.</i> And at the same time the discrepancies
between lesion and symptom in different cases of
the disease have been largely cleared up. In some individuals
the habitual 'thought-stuff,' if one may so call it,
is visual; in others it is auditory, articulatory, or motor;
in most, perhaps, it is evenly mixed. The same local cerebral
injury must needs work different practical results in persons
who differ in this way. In one it will throw a much-used
brain-tract out of gear; in the other it may affect an
unimportant region. A particularly instructive case was
published by Charcot in 1883.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The patient was</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. X., a merchant, born in Vienna, highly educated, master of
German, Spanish, French, Greek, and Latin. Up to the beginning of
the malady which took him to Professor Charcot, he read Homer at
sight. He could, starting from any verse out of the first book of the
Iliad, repeat the following verses without hesitating, by heart. Virgil
and Horace were familiar. He also knew enough of modern Greek for
business purposes. Up to within a year (from the time Charcot saw
him) he enjoyed an exceptional <i>visual</i> memory. He no sooner thought
of persons or things, but features, forms, and colors arose with the
same clearness, sharpness, and accuracy as if the objects stood before
him. When he tried to recall a fact or a figure in his voluminous
polyglot correspondence, the letters themselves appeared before him
with their entire content, irregularities, erasures and all. At school he
recited from a mentally seen page which he read off line by line and
letter by letter. In making computations, he ran his mental eye down
imaginary columns of figures, and performed in this way the most
varied operations of arithmetic. He could never think of a passage in
a play without the entire scene, stage, actors, and audience appearing
to him. He had been a great traveller. Being a good draughtsman,
he used to sketch views which pleased him; and his memory always
brought back the entire landscape exactly. If he thought of a conversation,
a saying, an engagement, the place, the people, the entire scene
rose before his mind.</p>

<p>His <i>auditory memory</i> was always deficient, or at least secondary.
He had no taste for music.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>A year and a half previous to examination, after business-anxieties,
loss of sleep, appetite, etc., he noticed suddenly one day an extraordinary
change in himself. After complete confusion, there came a violent
contrast between his old and his new state. Everything about him
seemed so new and foreign that at first he thought he must be going
mad. He was nervous and irritable. Although he saw all things distinct,
he had entirely lost his memory for forms and colors. On ascertaining
this, he became reassured as to his sanity. He soon discovered
that he could carry on his affairs by using his memory in an altogether
new way. He can now describe clearly the difference between his two
conditions.</p>

<p>Every time he returns to A., from which place business often calls
him, he seems to himself as if entering a strange city. He views the
monuments, houses, and streets with the same surprise as if he saw
them for the first time. Gradually, however, his memory returns, and
he finds himself at home again. When asked to describe the principal
public place of the town, he answered, "I know that it is there, but it
is impossible to imagine it, and I can tell you nothing about it." He has
often drawn the port of A. To-day he vainly tries to trace its principal
outlines. Asked to draw a minaret, he reflects, says it is a square
tower, and draws, rudely, four lines, one for ground, one for top, and
two for sides. Asked to draw an arcade, he says, "I remember that it
contains semi-circular arches, and that two of them meeting at an angle
make a vault, but how it <i>looks</i> I am absolutely unable to imagine." The
profile of a man which he drew by request was as if drawn by a little
child; and yet he confessed that he had been helped to draw it by looking
at the bystanders. Similarly he drew a shapeless scribble for a
tree.</p>

<p>He can no more remember his wife's and children's faces than he
can remember the port of A. Even after being with them some time
they seem unusual to him. He forgets his own face, and once spoke
to his image in a mirror, taking it for a stranger. He complains of his
loss of feeling for colors. "My wife has black hair, this I know; but
I can no more recall its color than I can her person and features."
This visual amnesia extends to dating objects from his childhood's
years&mdash;paternal mansion, etc., forgotten.</p>

<p>No other disturbances but this loss of visual images. Now when he
seeks something in his correspondence, he must rummage among the
letters like other men, until he meets the passage. He can recall only
the first few verses of the Iliad, and must <i>grope</i> to read Homer, Virgil,
and Horace. Figures which he adds he must now whisper to himself.
He realises clearly that he must help his memory out with auditory
images, which he does with effort. <i>The words and expressions which
he recalls seem now to echo in his ear, an altogether novel sensation for
him.</i> If he wishes to learn by heart anything, a series of phrases for
example, he must <i>read them several times aloud</i>, so as to impress his
ear. When later he repeats the thing in question, the sensation of inward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
hearing which precedes articulation rises up in his mind. This
feeling was formerly unknown to him. He speaks French fluently; but
affirms that he can no longer think in French; but must get his French
words by translating them from Spanish or German, the languages of
his childhood. He dreams no more in visual terms, but only in words,
usually Spanish words. A certain degree of verbal blindness affects
him&mdash;he is troubled by the Greek alphabet, etc.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If this patient had possessed the auditory type of imagination
from the start, it is evident that the injury, whatever
it was, to his centres for optical imagination, would
have affected his practical life much less profoundly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>The auditory type</i>," says M. A. Binet,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> "<i>appears to be rarer than
the visual.</i> Persons of this type imagine what they think of in the
language of sound. In order to remember a lesson they impress upon
their mind, not the look of the page, but the sound of the words.
They reason, as well as remember, by ear. In performing a mental addition
they repeat verbally the names of the figures, and add, as it
were, the sounds, without any thought of the graphic signs. Imagination
also takes the auditory form. 'When I write a scene,' said
Legouvé to Scribe, 'I <i>hear</i>; but you <i>see</i>. In each phrase which I write,
the voice of the personage who speaks strikes my ear. <i>Vous, qui êtes le
théâtre même</i>, your actors walk, gesticulate before your eyes; I am a
<i>listener</i>, you a <i>spectator</i>.'&mdash;'Nothing more true,' said Scribe; 'do you
know where I am when I write a piece? In the middle of the parterre.'
It is clear that the <i>pure audile</i>, seeking to develop only a single one of
his faculties, may, like the pure visualizer, perform astounding feats
of memory&mdash;Mozart, for example, noting from memory the <i>Miserere</i> of
the Sistine Chapel after two hearings; the deaf Beethoven, composing
and inwardly repeating his enormous symphonies. On the other hand,
the man of auditory type, like the visual, is exposed to serious dangers;
for if he lose his auditory images, he is without resource and breaks
down completely.</p>

<p>"It is possible that persons with hallucinations of hearing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
individuals afflicted with the mania that they are victims of persecution,
may all belong to the auditory type; and that the predominance of a
certain kind of imagination may predispose to a certain order of hallucinations,
and perhaps of delirium.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The <i>motor type</i> remains&mdash;perhaps the most interesting of all,
and certainly the one of which least is known. Persons who belong to
this type [<i>les moteurs</i>, in French, <i>motiles</i>, as Mr. Galton proposes to
call them in English] make use, in memory, reasoning, and all their
intellectual operations, of images derived from movement. In order to
understand this important point, it is enough to remember that 'all
our perceptions, and in particular the important ones, those of sight
and touch, contain as integral elements the movements of our eyes and
limbs; and that, if movement is ever an essential factor in our really
seeing an object, it must be an equally essential factor when we see the
same object in imagination' (Ribot).<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> For example, the complex impression
of a ball, which is there, in our hand, is the resultant of optical
impressions of touch, of muscular adjustments of the eye, of the movements
of our fingers, and of the muscular sensations which these yield.
When we imagine the ball, its idea must include the images of these
muscular sensations, just as it includes those of the retinal and epidermal
sensations. They form so many <i>motor images</i>. If they were not
earlier recognized to exist, that is because our knowledge of the muscular
sense is relatively so recent. In older psychologies it never was
mentioned, the number of senses being restricted to five.</p>

<p>"There are persons who remember a drawing better when they have
followed its outlines with their finger. Lecoq de Boisbaudran used this
means in his artistic teaching, in order to accustom his pupils to draw
from memory. He made them follow the outlines of figures with a
pencil held in the air, forcing them thus to associate muscular with
visual memory. Galton quotes a curious corroborative fact. Colonel
Moncrieff often observed in North America young Indians who, visiting
occasionally his quarters, interested themselves greatly in the
engravings which were shown them. One of them followed with care
with the point of his knife the outline of a drawing in the Illustrated
London News, saying that this was to enable him to carve it out the
better on his return home. In this ease the motor images were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
reinforce the visual ones. The young savage was a <i>motor</i>....<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> When
one's motor images are destroyed, one loses one's remembrance of movements,
and sometimes, more curiously still, one loses the power of executing
them. Pathology gives us examples in motor aphasia, agraphia,
etc. Take the case of agraphia. An educated man, knowing how to
write, suddenly loses this power, as a result of cerebral injury. His
hand and arm are in no way paralytic, yet he cannot write. Whence
this loss of power? He tells us himself: he no longer knows how. He
has forgotten how to set about it to trace the letters, he has lost the
memory of the movements to be executed, he has no longer the motor
images which, when formerly he wrote, directed his hand.... Other
patients, affected with word-blindness, resort to these motor images
precisely to make amends for their other deficiency.... An individual
affected in this way cannot read letters which are placed before his
eyes, even although his sight be good enough for the purpose. This loss
of the power of reading by sight may, at a certain time, be the only
trouble the patient has. Individuals thus mutilated succeed in reading
by an ingenious roundabout way which they often discover themselves:
it is enough that they should trace the letters with their finger to understand
their sense. What happens in such a case? How can the hand
supply the place of the eye? The motor image gives the key to the
problem. If the patient can read, so to speak, with his fingers, it is
because in tracing the letters he gives himself a certain number of muscular
impressions which are those of writing. In one word, the patient
reads by writing (Charcot): the feeling of the graphic movements suggests
the sense of what is being written as well as sight would."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The imagination of a blind-deaf mute like Laura Bridgman
must be confined entirely to tactile and motor material.
<i>All blind persons must belong to the 'tactile' and 'motile' types</i> of
the French authors. When the young man whose cataracts
were removed by Dr. Franz was shown different geometric
figures, he said he "had not been able to form from them
the idea of a square and a disk until he perceived a sensation
of what he saw in the points of his fingers, as if he
really touched the objects."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Professor Stricker of Vienna, who seems to have the
motile form of imagination developed in unusual strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
has given a very careful analysis of his own case in a
couple of monographs with which all students should become
familiar.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> His recollections both of his own movements
and of those of other things are accompanied
invariably by distinct muscular feelings in those parts of
his body which would naturally be used in effecting or in
following the movement. In thinking of a soldier marching,
for example, it is as if he were helping the image to
march by marching himself in his rear. And if he suppresses
this sympathetic feeling in his own legs, and concentrates
all his attention on the imagined soldier, the latter
becomes, as it were, paralyzed. In general his imagined
movements, of whatsoever objects, seem paralyzed the
moment no feelings of movement either in his own eyes or
in his own limbs accompany them.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The movements of
articulate speech play a predominant part in his mental
life.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When after my experimental work I proceed to its description,
as a rule I reproduce in the first instance only words, which I had
already associated with the perception of the various details of the observation
whilst the latter was going on. For speech plays in all my
observing so important a part that I ordinarily clothe phenomena in
words as fast as I observe them."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Most persons, on being asked <i>in what sort of terms they
imagine words</i>, will say 'in terms of hearing.' It is not until
their attention is expressly drawn to the point that they
find it difficult to say whether auditory images or motor
images connected with the organs of articulation predominate.
A good way of bringing the difficulty to consciousness
is that proposed by Stricker: Partly open your mouth and
then imagine any word with labials or dentals in it, such as
'bubble, 'toddle.' Is your image under these conditions
distinct? To most people the image is at first 'thick,' as
the sound of the word would be if they tried to pronounce
it with the lips parted. Many can never imagine the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
clearly with the mouth open; others succeed after a few
preliminary trials. The experiment proves how dependent
our verbal imagination is on actual feelings in lips, tongue,
throat, larynx, etc.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When we recall the impression of a word or sentence, if we do not
speak it out, we feel the twitter of the organs just about to come to
that point. The articulating parts&mdash;the larynx, the tongue, the lips&mdash;are
all sensibly excited; a <i>suppressed articulation is in fact the material
of our recollection</i>, the intellectual manifestation, the <i>idea</i> of
speech."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The open mouth in Stricker's experiment not only prevents
actual articulation of the labials, but our feeling of
its openness keeps us from imagining their articulation,
just as a sensation of glaring light will keep us from
strongly imagining darkness. In persons whose auditory
imagination is weak, the articulatory image seems to constitute
the whole material for verbal thought. Professor
Stricker says that in his own case no auditory image enters
into the words of which he thinks.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Like most psychologists,
however, he makes of his personal peculiarities a rule,
and says that verbal thinking is normally and universally
an exclusively motor representation. <i>I</i> certainly get
auditory images, both of vowels and of consonants, in
addition to the articulatory images or feelings on which
this author lays such stress. And I find that numbers of
my students, after repeating his experiments, come to this
conclusion. There is <i>at first</i> a difficulty due to the open
mouth. That, however, soon vanishes, as does also the
difficulty of thinking of one vowel whilst continuously
sounding another. What probably remains true, however,
is that most men have a less auditory and a more articulatory
verbal imagination than they are apt to be aware of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Professor Stricker himself has acoustic images, and can
imagine the sounds of musical instruments, and the peculiar
voice of a friend. A statistical inquiry on a large scale,
into the variations of acoustic, tactile, and motor imagination,
would probably bear less fruit than Galton's inquiry
into visual images. A few monographs by competent observers,
like Stricker, about their own peculiarities, would
give much more valuable information about the diversities
which prevail.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><i>Touch-images</i> are very strong in some people. The most
vivid touch-images come when we ourselves barely escape
local injury, or when we see another injured. The place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
may then actually tingle with the imaginary sensation&mdash;perhaps
not altogether imaginary, since goose-flesh, paling
or reddening, and other evidences of actual muscular
contraction in the spot may result.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An educated man," says a writer who must always be quoted when
it is question of the powers of imagination,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> "told me once that on
entering his house one day he received a shock from crushing the finger
of one of his little children in the door. At the moment of his fright
he felt a violent pain in the corresponding finger of his own body,
and this pain abode with him three days."</p></blockquote>

<p>The same author makes the following discrimination,
which probably most men could verify:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the skin I easily succeed in bringing out suggested sensations
wherever I will. But because it is necessary to protract the mental effort
I can only awaken such sensations as are in their nature prolonged,
as warmth, cold, pressure. Fleeting sensations, as those of a prick, a
cut, a blow, etc., I am unable to call up, because I cannot imagine them
<i>ex abrupto</i> with the requisite intensity. The sensations of the former
order I can excite upon any part of the skin; and they may become so
lively that, whether I will or not, I have to pass my hand over the place
just as if it were a real impression on the skin."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Meyer's account of his own visual images</i> is very interesting;
and with it we may close our survey of differences between
the normal powers of imagining in different individuals.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With much practice," he says, "I have succeeded in making it
possible for me to call up subjective visual sensations at will. I tried
all my experiments by day or at night with closed eyes. At first it
was very difficult. In the first experiments which succeeded the whole
picture was luminous, the shadows being given in a somewhat less strong
bluish light. In later experiments I saw the objects dark, with
bright outlines, or rather I saw outline drawings of them, bright on a
dark ground. I can compare these drawings less to chalk drawings on
a blackboard than to drawings made with phosphorus on a dark wall
at night, though the phosphorus would show luminous vapors which
were absent from my lines. If I wished, for example, to see a face,
without intending that of a particular person, I saw the outline of a
profile against the dark background. When I tried to repeat an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
experiment of the elder Darwin I saw only the edges of the die as bright
lines on a dark ground. Sometimes, however, I saw the die really white
and its edges black; it was then on a paler ground. I could soon at
will change between a white die with black borders on a light field, and
a black die with white borders on a dark field; and I can do this at any
moment now. After long practice ... these experiments succeeded
better still. I can now call before my eyes almost any object which I
please, as a subjective appearance, and this in its own natural color and
illumination. I see them almost always on a more or less light or dark,
mostly dimly changeable ground. Even known faces I can see quite
sharp, with the true color of hair and cheeks. It is odd that I see
these faces mostly in profile, whereas those described [in the previous
extract] were all full-face. Here are some of the final results of these
experiments:</p>

<p>"1) Some time after the pictures have arisen they vanish or change
into others, without my being able to prevent it.</p>

<p>"2) When the color does not integrally belong to the object, I cannot
always control it. A face, e.g., never seems to me blue, but always in
its natural color; a red cloth, on the other hand, I can sometimes
change to a blue one.</p>

<p>"3) I have sometimes succeeded in seeing pure colors without objects;
they then fill the entire field of view.</p>

<p>"4) I often fail to see objects which are not known to me, mere fictions
of my fancy, and instead of them there will appear familiar objects
of a similar sort; for instance, I once tried to see a brass sword-hilt
with a brass guard, instead of which the more familiar picture of a
rapier-guard appeared.</p>

<p>"5) Most of these subjective appearances, especially when they were
bright, left after-images behind them when the eyes were quickly
opened during their presence. For example, I thought of a silver stirrup,
and after I had looked at it a while I opened my eyes and for a
long while afterwards saw its after-image.</p>

<p>"These experiments succeeded best when I lay quietly on my back
and closed my eyes. I could bear no noise about me, as this kept the
vision from attaining the requisite intensity. The experiments succeed
with me now so easily that I am surprised they did not do so at first,
and I feel as though they ought to succeed with everyone. The important
point in them is to get the image sufficiently intense by the exclusive
direction of the attention upon it, and by the removal of all
disturbing impressions."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The negative after-images which succeeded upon Meyer's
imagination when he opened his eyes</i> are a highly interesting,
though rare, phenomenon. So far as I know there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
only one other published report of a similar experience.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> It
would seem that in such a case the neural process corresponding
to the imagination must be the entire tract concerned
in the actual sensation, even down as far as the
retina. This leads to a new question to which we may
now turn&mdash;of what is</p>


<h4>THE NEURAL PROCESS WHICH UNDERLIES IMAGINATION?</h4>


<p>The commonly-received idea is that it is only a milder
degree of the same process which took place when the
thing now imagined was sensibly perceived. Professor
Bain writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since a sensation in the first instance diffuses nerve-currents
through the interior of the brain outwards to the organs of expression
and movement,&mdash;the persistence of that sensation, after the outward
exciting cause is withdrawn, can be but a continuance of the same diffusive
currents, perhaps less intense, but not otherwise different. The
shock remaining in the ear and brain, after the sound of thunder, must
pass through the same circles, and operate in the same way as during
the actual sound. We can have no reason for believing that, in this
self-sustaining condition, the impression changes its seat, or passes into
some new circles that have the special property of retaining it. Every
part actuated <i>after</i> the shock must have been actuated <i>by</i> the shock,
only more powerfully. With this single difference of intensity, the mode
of existence of a sensation existing after the fact is essentially the same
as its mode of existence during the fact.... Now if this be the case
with impressions <i>persisting</i> when the cause has ceased, what view are
we to adopt concerning impressions <i>reproduced</i> by mental causes alone,
or without the aid of the original, as in ordinary recollection? What
is the manner of occupation of the brain with a resuscitated feeling of
resistance, a smell or a sound? There is only one answer that seems
admissable. <i>The renewed feeling occupies the very same parts, and in
the same manner, as the original feeling, and no other parts, nor in
any other assignable manner.</i> I imagine that if our present knowledge
of the brain had been present to the earliest speculators, this is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
hypothesis that would have occurred to them. For where should a
past feeling be embodied, if not in the same organs as the feeling when
present? It is only in this way that its identity can be preserved; a
feeling differently embodied would be a different feeling."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is not plain from Professor Bain's text whether by
the 'same parts' he means only the same parts <i>inside the
brain</i>, or the same <i>peripheral</i> parts also, as those occupied by
the original feeling. The examples which he himself proceeds
to give are almost all cases of imagination of <i>movement</i>,
in which the peripheral organs are indeed affected,
for actual movements of a weak sort are found to accompany
the idea. This is what we should expect. All currents
tend to run forward in the brain and discharge into
the muscular system; and the idea of a movement tends to
do this with peculiar facility. But the question remains:
Do currents run <i>backward</i>, so that if the optical centres
(for example) are excited by 'association' and a visual object
is imagined, a current runs <i>down to the retina</i> also,
and excites that sympathetically with the higher tracts?
In other words, <i>can peripheral sense-organs be excited from
above, or only from without? Are they excited in imagination?</i>
Professor Bain's instances are almost silent as to
this point. All he says is this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We might think of a blow on the hand until the skin were actually
irritated and inflamed. The attention very much directed to any part
of the body, as the great toe, for instance, is apt to produce a distinct
feeling in the part, which we account for only by supposing a revived
nerve-current to flow there, making a sort of false sensation, an influence
from within mimicking the influences from without in sensation
proper.&mdash;(See the writings of Mr. Braid, of Manchester, on Hypnotism,
etc.)"</p></blockquote>

<p>If I may judge from my own experience, all feelings of
this sort are consecutive upon motor currents invading the
skin and producing contraction of the muscles there, the
muscles whose contraction gives 'goose-flesh' when it takes
place on an extensive scale. I never get a <i>feeling</i> in the
skin, however strongly I <i>imagine</i> it, until some actual
change in the condition of the skin itself has occurred.
The truth seems to be that the cases where peripheral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
sense-organs are directly excited in consequence of imagination
are exceptional rarities, if they exist at all. <i>In common
cases of imagination it would seem more natural to suppose
that the seat of the process is purely cerebral, and that the sense-organ
is left out.</i> Reasons for such a conclusion would be
briefly these:</p>

<p>1) In imagination the <i>starting-point</i> of the process must
be in the brain. Now we know that currents usually flow
one way in the nervous system; and for the peripheral sense-organs
to be excited in these cases, the current would have
to flow backward.</p>

<p>2) There is between imagined objects and felt objects
a difference of conscious quality which may be called almost
absolute. It is hardly possible to confound the liveliest
image of fancy with the weakest real sensation. The
felt object has a plastic reality and outwardness which the
imagined object wholly lacks. Moreover, as Fechner says,
in imagination the attention feels as if drawn backwards to
the brain; in sensation (even of after-images) it is directed
forward towards the sense-organ.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The difference between
the two processes feels like one of kind, and not like a mere
'more' or 'less' of the same.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> If a sensation of sound
were only a strong imagination, and an imagination a weak
sensation, there ought to be a border-line of experience
where we never could tell whether we were hearing a weak
sound or imagining a strong one. In comparing a present
sensation felt with a past one imagined, it will be remembered
that we often judge the imagined one to <i>have been the
stronger</i> (see above, Vol. I p. 500, note). This is inexplicable if
the imagination be simply a weaker excitement of the sensational
process.</p>

<p>To these reasons the following objections may be made:</p>

<p>To 1): The current demonstrably <i>does</i> flow backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
down the optic nerve in Meyer's and Féré's negative after-image.
Therefore it <i>can</i> flow backward; therefore it <i>may</i>
flow backward in some, however slight, degree, in all imagination.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>To 2): The difference alleged is not absolute, and sensation
and imagination <i>are</i> hard to discriminate where the
sensation is so weak as to be just perceptible. At night
hearing a very faint striking of the hour by a far-off clock,
our imagination reproduces both rhythm and sound, and it
is often difficult to tell which was the last real stroke. So
of a baby crying in a distant part of the house, we are uncertain
whether we still hear it, or only imagine the sound.
Certain violin-players take advantage of this in diminuendo
terminations. After the pianissimo has been reached
they continue to bow as if still playing, but are careful not
to touch the strings. The listener hears in imagination a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
degree of sound fainter still than the preceding pianissimo.
This phenomenon is not confined to hearing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If we slowly approach our finger to a surface of water, we often
deceive ourselves about the moment in which the wetting occurs. The
apprehensive patient believes himself to feel the knife of the surgeon
whilst it is still at some distance."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Visual perception supplies numberless instances in which
the same sensation of vision is perceived as one object or
another according to the interpretation of the mind. Many
of these instances will come before us in the course of the
next two chapters; and in <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chapter XIX</a> similar illusions
will be described in the other senses. Taken together, all
these facts would force us to admit that <i>the subjective
difference between imagined and felt objects is less absolute
than has been claimed, and that the cortical processes which
underlie imagination and sensation are not quite as discrete
as one at first is tempted to suppose. That peripheral sensory
processes are ordinarily involved in imagination seems
improbable; that they may sometimes be aroused from the cortex
downwards cannot, however, be dogmatically denied.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The imagination-process</i> <span class="smcap">can</span> <i>then pass over into the sensation-process.</i>
In other words, genuine sensations <i>can</i> be
centrally originated. When we come to study hallucinations
in the chapter on Outer Perception, we shall see that
this is by no means a thing of rare occurrence. At present,
however, we must admit that <i>normally the two processes do</i>
<span class="smcap">not</span> <i>pass over into each other</i>; and we must inquire why.
One of two things must be the reason. Either</p>

<p>1. Sensation-processes occupy a different <i>locality</i> from
imagination-processes; or</p>

<p>2. Occupying the same locality, they have an <i>intensity</i>
which under normal circumstances currents from other
cortical regions are incapable of arousing, and to produce
which currents from the periphery are required.</p>

<p><i>It seems almost certain</i> (after what was said in Chapter
II. pp. 49-51) <i>that the imagination-process differs from the
sensation-process by its intensity rather than by its locality.</i>
However it may be with lower animals, the assumption that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
ideational and sensorial centres are locally distinct appears
to be supported by no facts drawn from the observation of
human beings. After occipital destruction, the hemianopsia
which results in man is sensorial blindness, not mere
loss of optical ideas. Were there centres for crude optical
sensation below the cortex, the patients in these cases
would still feel light and darkness. Since they do not preserve
even this impression on the lost half of the field, we
must suppose that there are no centres for vision of any
sort whatever below the cortex, and that the corpora quadrigemina
and other lower optical ganglia are organs for reflex
movement of eye-muscles and not for conscious sight.
Moreover there are no facts which oblige us to think that,
within the occipital cortex, one part is connected with sensation
and another with mere ideation or imagination. The
pathological cases assumed to prove this are all better explained
by disturbances of conduction between the optical
and other centres (see <a href="#Page_50">p. 50</a>). In bad cases of hemianopsia
the patient's images depart from him together with his sensibility
to light. They depart so completely that he does not
even know what is the matter with him. To perceive that
one is blind to the right half of the field of view one must
have an idea of that part of the field's possible existence.
But the defect in these patients has to be revealed to them
by the doctor, they themselves only knowing that there is
'something wrong' with their eyes. What you have no idea
of you cannot miss; and their not definitely missing this
great region out of their sight seems due to the fact that their
very idea and memory of it is lost along with the sensation.
A man blind of his eyes merely, sees <i>darkness</i>. A man blind
of his visual brain-centres can no more see darkness out of
the parts of his retina which are connected with the brain-lesion
than he can see it out of the skin of his back. He
cannot see at all in that part of the field; and he cannot
think of the light which he ought to be feeling <i>there</i>, for the
very notion of the existence of that particular 'there' is
cut out of his mind.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>Now if we admit that sensation and imagination are due
to the activity of the same centres in the cortex, we can see a
very good teleological reason why they should correspond
to discrete kinds of process in these centres, and why the
process which gives the sense that the object is really there
ought normally to be arousable only by currents entering
from the periphery and not by currents from the neighboring
cortical parts. We can see, in short, why <i>the sensational
process</i> <span class="smcap">ought to</span> <i>be discontinuous with all normal ideational
processes, however intense</i>. For, as Dr. Münsterberg justly
observes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Were there not this peculiar arrangement we should not distinguish
reality and fantasy, our conduct would not be accommodated to the
facts about us, but would be inappropriate and senseless, and we could
not keep ourselves alive.... That our thoughts and memories should
be copies of sensations with their intensity greatly reduced is thus a
consequence deducible logically from the natural adaptation of the
cerebral mechanism to its environment."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Mechanically the discontinuity between the ideational
and the sensational kinds of process must mean that when
the greatest ideational intensity has been reached, an order
of <i>resistance</i> presents itself which only a new order of force
can break through. The current from the periphery is the
new order of force required; and what happens after the
resistance is overcome is the sensational process. We may
suppose that the latter consists in some new and more violent
sort of disintegration of the neural matter, which now
explodes at a deeper level than at other times.</p>

<p>Now how shall we conceive of the 'resistance' which
prevents this sort of disintegration from taking place, this
sort of intensity in the process from being attained, so
much of the time? It must be either an intrinsic resistance,
some force of cohesion in the neural molecules themselves;
or an extrinsic influence, due to other cortical cells.
When we come to study the process of hallucination we
shall see that both factors must be taken into account.
There is a degree of inward molecular cohesion in our
brain-cells which it probably takes a sudden inrush of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
destructive energy to spring apart. Incoming peripheral
currents possess this energy from the outset. Currents
from neighboring cortical regions might attain to it if they
could <i>accumulate</i> within the centre which we are supposed
to be considering. But since during waking hours every
centre communicates with others by association-paths,
no such accumulation can take place. The cortical currents
which run in run right out again, awakening the next
ideas; the level of tension in the cells does not rise to the
higher explosion-point; and the latter must be gained by a
sudden current from the periphery or not at all.</p>

Finally, Fechner speaks of the impossibility of attending to both after-images
and imagination-images at once, even when they are of the same
object and might be expected to combine. All these differences are true
of Fechner; but many of them would be untrue of other persons. I quote
them as a type of observation which any reader with sufficient patience
may repeat. To them may be added, as a universal proposition, that after-images
seem larger if we project them on a distant screen, and smaller if
we project them on a near one, whilst no such change takes place in mental
pictures.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> I think it must be admitted that some people have no vivid substantive
images in <i>any</i> department of their sensibility. One of my students,
an intelligent youth, denied so pertinaciously that there was <i>anything</i> in his
mind <i>at all</i> when he thought, that I was much perplexed by his case. I myself
certainly have no such vivid play of nascent movements or motor images
as Professor Stricker describes. When I seek to represent a row of soldiers
marching, all I catch is a view of stationary legs first in one phase of
movement and then in another, and these views are extremely imperfect
and momentary. Occasionally (especially when I try to stimulate my
imagination, as by repeating Victor Hugo's lines about the regiment,
</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Leur pas est si correct, sans tarder ni courir,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Qu'on croit voir des ciseaux se fermer et s'ouvrir,")</span><br />
</p>
<p>
I seem to get an instantaneous glimpse of an actual movement, but it is to
the last degree dim and uncertain. All these images seem at first as if
purely retinal. I think, however, that rapid eye-movements accompany
them, though these latter give rise to such slight feelings that they are
almost impossible of detection. Absolutely no leg-movements of my own
are there; in fact, to call such up arrests my imagination of the soldiers.
My optical images are in general very dim, dark, fugitive, and contracted.
It would be utterly impossible to <i>draw</i> from them, and yet I perfectly well
distinguish one from the other. My auditory images are excessively inadequate
reproductions of their originals. I have <i>no</i> images of taste or smell.
Touch-imagination is fairly distinct, but comes very little into play with
most objects thought of. Neither is all my thought verbalized; for I have
shadowy schemes of relation, as apt to terminate in a nod of the head or an
expulsion of the breath as in a definite word. On the whole, vague images
or sensations of movement inside of my head towards the various parts of
space in which the terms I am thinking of either lie or are momentarily symbolized
to lie together with movements of the breath through my pharynx
and nostrils, form a by no means inconsiderable part of my <i>thought-stuff</i>.
I doubt whether my difficulty in giving a clearer account is wholly a matter
of inferior power of introspective attention, though that doubtless plays
its part. Attention, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, must always be inferior in proportion
to the feebleness of the internal images which are offered it to hold on to.</p></div>

Suggest to a 'Subject' in the hypnotic trance that a sheet of paper has a
red cross upon it, then pretend to remove the imaginary cross, whilst you
tell the Subject to look fixedly at a dot upon the paper, and he will presently
tell you that he sees a 'bluish-green' cross. The genuineness of the
result has been doubted, but there seems no good reason for rejecting M.
Binet's account (Le Magnetisme Animal, 1887, p. 188). M. Binet, following
M. Parinaud, and on the faith of a certain experiment, at one time believed,
the optical brain-centres and not the retina to be the seat of ordinary negative
after-images. The experiment is this: Look fixedly, with one eye
open, at a colored spot on a white background. Then close that eye and
look fixedly with the <i>other</i> eye at a plain surface. A negative after-image
of the colored spot will presently appear. (Psychologie du Raisonnement,
1886, p. 45.) But Mr. Delabarre has proved (American Journal of Psychology,
ii. 326) that this after-image is due, not to a higher cerebral process,
but to the fact that the retinal process in the <i>closed</i> eye affects
consciousness at certain moments, and that its object is then projected
into the field seen by the eye which is open. M. Binet informs me that
he is converted by the proofs given by Mr. Delabarre.
</p>
<p>
The fact remains, however, that the negative after-images of Herr Meyer,
M. Féré, and the hypnotic subjects, form an exception to all that we know
of nerve-currents, if they are due to a refluent centrifugal current to the
retina. It may be that they will hereafter be explained in some other way.
Meanwhile we can only write them down as a paradox. Sig. Sergi's theory
that there is <i>always</i> a refluent wave in perception hardly merits serious consideration
(Psychologie Physiologique, pp. 99, 189). Sergi's theory has
recently been reaffirmed with almost incredible crudity by Lombroso and
Ottolenghi in the Revue Philosophique, xxix. 70 (Jan. 1890).</p></div>

<h4>THE PERCEPTION OF 'THINGS.'</h4>

<h4>PERCEPTION AND SENSATION COMPARED.</h4>


<p>A pure sensation we saw above, <a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>, to be an abstraction
never realized in adult life. Any quality of a thing
which affects our sense-organs does also more than that:
it arouses processes in the hemispheres which are due to
the organization of that organ by past experiences, and the
result of which in consciousness are commonly described
as ideas which the sensation suggests. The first of these
ideas is that of the <i>thing</i> to which the sensible quality
belongs. <i>The consciousness of particular material things
present to sense</i> is nowadays called <i>perception</i>.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The consciousness
of such things may be more or less complete;
it may be of the mere name of the thing and its other essential
attributes, or it may be of the thing's various remoter
relations. It is impossible to draw any sharp line of distinction
between the barer and the richer consciousness,
because the moment we get beyond the first crude sensation
all our consciousness is a matter of suggestion, and
the various suggestions shade gradually into each other,
being one and all products of the same psychological
machinery of association. In the directer consciousness
fewer, in the remoter more, associative processes are
brought into play.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Perception thus differs from sensation by the consciousness
of farther facts associated with the object of the sensation:</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I lift my eyes from the paper on which I am writing I see
the chairs and tables and walls of my room, each of its proper shape
and at its proper distance. I see, from my window, trees and meadows,
and horses and oxen, and distant hills. I see each of its proper
size, of its proper form, and at its proper distance; and these particulars
appear as immediate informations of the eye, as the colors which I
see by means of it. Yet philosophy has ascertained that we derive nothing
from the eye whatever but sensations of color.... How, then, is it
that we receive accurate information, by the eye, of size and shape and
distance? By association merely. The colors upon a body are different,
according to its figure, its shape, and its size. But the sensations of
color and what we may here, for brevity, call the sensations of extension,
of figure, of distance, have been so often united, felt in conjunction,
that the sensation of the color is never experienced without
raising the ideas of the extension, the figure, the distance, in such intimate
union with it, that they not only cannot be separated, but are actually
supposed to be seen. The sight, as it is called, of figure, or distance,
appearing as it does a simple sensation, is in reality a complex
state of consciousness&mdash;a sequence in which the antecedent, a sensation
of color, and the consequent, a number of ideas, are so closely combined
by association that they appear not one idea, but one sensation."</p></blockquote>

<p>This passage from James Mill<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> gives a clear statement
of the doctrine which Berkeley in his Theory of Vision
made for the first time an integral part of Psychology.
Berkeley compared our visual sensations to the words of a
language, which are but signs or occasions for our intellects
to pass to what the speaker means. As the sounds
called words have no inward affinity with the ideas they
signify, so neither have our visual sensations, according to
Berkeley, any inward affinity with the things of whose
presence they make us aware. Those things are <i>tangibles;</i>
their real properties, such as shape, size, mass, consistency,
position, reveal themselves only to touch. But the visible
signs and the tangible significates are by long custom so
"closely twisted, blended, and incorporated together, and
the prejudice is so confirmed and riveted in our thoughts
by a long tract of time, by the use of language, and want of
reflection,"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> that we think we <i>see</i> the whole object, tangible
and visible alike, in one simple indivisible act.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Sensational and reproductive brain-processes combined, then,
are what give us the content of our perceptions.</i> Every concrete
particular material thing is a conflux of sensible
qualities, with which we have become acquainted at various
times. Some of these qualities, since they are more
constant, interesting, or practically important, we regard as
essential constituents of the thing. In a general way, such
are the tangible shape, size, mass, etc. Other properties,
being more fluctuating, we regard as more or less accidental
or inessential. We call the former qualities the reality,
the latter its appearances. Thus, I hear a sound, and say
'a horse-car'; but the sound is not the horse-car, it is
one of the horse-car's least important manifestations. The
real horse-car is a feelable, or at most a feelable and visible,
thing which in my imagination the sound calls up. So
when I get, as now, a brown eye-picture with lines not
parallel, and with angles unlike, and call it my big solid
rectangular walnut library-table, that picture is not the
table. It is not even like the table as the table is for vision,
when rightly seen. It is a distorted perspective view of three
of the sides of what I mentally <i>perceive</i> (more or less) in its
totality and undistorted shape. The back of the table, its
square corners, its size, its heaviness, are features of which
I am conscious when I look, almost as I am conscious of
its name. The suggestion of the name is of course due to
mere custom. But no less is that of the back, the size,
weight, squareness, etc.</p>

<p>Nature, as Reid says, is frugal in her operations, and
will not be at the expense of a particular instinct to give
us that knowledge which experience and habit will soon
produce. Reproduced sights and contacts tied together
with the present sensation in the unity of a <i>thing</i> with a
name, these are the complex objective stuff out of which
my actually perceived table is made. Infants must go
through a long education of the eye and ear before they
can perceive the realities which adults perceive. <i>Every
perception is an acquired perception.</i><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Perception may then be defined</i>, in Mr. Sully's words, as
that process by which the mind</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"supplements a sense-impression by an accompaniment or escort of revived
sensations, the whole aggregate of actual and revived sensations
being solidified or 'integrated' into the form of a percept, that is, an
apparently immediate apprehension or cognition of an object now
present in a particular locality or region of space."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Every reader's mind will supply abundant examples of
the process here described; and to write them down would
be therefore both unnecessary and tedious. In the chapter
on Space we have already discussed some of the more interesting
ones; for in our perceptions of shape and position it
is really difficult to decide how much of our sense of the object
is due to reproductions of past experience, and how
much to the immediate sensations of the eye. I shall accordingly
confine myself in the rest of this chapter to certain
additional generalities connected with the perceptive
process.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first point is relative to that 'solidification' or 'integration,'
whereof Mr. Sully speaks, of the present with
the absent and merely represented sensations. Cerebrally
taken, these words mean no more than this, that the process
aroused in the sense-organ has shot into various
paths which habit has already organized in the hemispheres,
and that instead of our having the sort of consciousness
which would be correlated with the simple sensorial
process, we have that which is correlated with this
more complex process. This, as it turns out, is the consciousness
of that more complex 'object,' the whole 'thing,'
instead of being the consciousness of that more simple
object, the few qualities or attributes which actually impress
our peripheral nerves. This consciousness must have
the unity which every 'section' of our stream of thought
retains so long as its objective content does not sensibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
change. More than this we cannot say; we certainly
ought not to say what usually is said by psychologists, and
treat the perception as a sum of distinct psychic entities,
the present sensation namely, <i>plus</i> a lot of images from the
past, all 'integrated' together in a way impossible to describe.
The perception is one state of mind or nothing&mdash;as
I have already so often said.</p>

<p>In many cases it is easy to compare the psychic results
of the sensational with those of the perceptive process. We
then see a marked difference in the way in which the impressed
portions of the object are felt, in consequence of
being cognized along with the reproduced portion, in the
higher state of mind. Their sensible quality changes under
our very eye. Take the already-quoted catch, <i>Pas de
lieu Rhône que nous</i>: one may read this over and over again
without recognizing the sounds to be identical with those
of the words <i>paddle your own canoe</i>. As we seize the
English meaning the sound itself appears to change.
Verbal sounds are usually perceived with their meaning at
the moment of being heard. Sometimes, however, the
associative irradiations are inhibited for a few moments
(the mind being preoccupied with other thoughts) whilst
the words linger on the ear as mere echoes of acoustic sensation.
Then, usually, their interpretation suddenly occurs.
But at that moment one may often surprise a change in the
very <i>feel</i> of the word. Our own language would sound
very different to us if we heard it without understanding,
as we hear a foreign tongue. Rises and falls of voice, odd
sibilants and other consonants, would fall on our ear in a
way of which we can now form no notion. Frenchmen say
that English sounds to them like the <i>gazouillement des oiseaux</i>&mdash;an
impression which it certainly makes on no native ear.
Many of us English would describe the sound of Russian
in similar terms. All of us are conscious of the strong inflections
of voice and explosives and gutturals of German
speech in a way in which no German can be conscious of
them.</p>

<p>This is probably the reason why, if we look at an isolated
printed word and repeat it long enough, it ends by assuming
an entirely unnatural aspect. Let the reader try this with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
any word on this page. He will soon begin to wonder if it
can possibly be the word he has been using all his life with
that meaning. It stares at him from the paper like a glass
eye, with no speculation in it. Its body is indeed there, but
its soul is fled. It is reduced, by this new way of attending
to it, to its sensational nudity. We never before attended to
it in this way, but habitually got it clad with its meaning
the moment we caught sight of it, and rapidly passed from
it to the other words of the phrase. We apprehended it,
in short, with a cloud of associates, and thus perceiving it,
we felt it quite otherwise than as we feel it now divested
and alone.</p>

<p>Another well-known change is when we look at a landscape
with our head upside down. Perception is to a certain
extent baffled by this manœuvre; gradations of distance
and other space-determinations are made uncertain;
the reproductive or associative processes, in short, decline;
and, simultaneously with their diminution, the colors grow
richer and more varied, and the contrasts of light and shade
more marked. The same thing occurs when we turn a
painting bottom upward. We lose much of its meaning,
but, to compensate for the loss, we feel more freshly the
value of the mere tints and shadings, and become aware of
any lack of purely sensible harmony or balance which they
may show.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Just so, if we lie on the floor and look up at
the mouth of a person talking behind us. His lower lip
here takes the habitual place of the upper one upon our
retina, and seems animated by the most extraordinary and
unnatural mobility, a mobility which now strikes us because
(the associative processes being disturbed by the unaccustomed
point of view) we get it as a naked sensation
and not as part of a familiar object perceived.</p>

<p>On a later page other instances will meet us. For the
present these are enough to prove our point. Once more
we find ourselves driven to admit that when qualities of an
object impress our sense and we thereupon perceive the
object, the sensation as such of those qualities does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
still exist inside of the perception and form a constituent
thereof. The sensation is one thing and the perception
another, and neither can take place at the same time with
the other, because their cerebral conditions are not the
same. They may <i>resemble</i> each other, but in no respect are
they identical states of mind.</p>


<h4>PERCEPTION IS OF DEFINITE AND PROBABLE THINGS.</h4>


<p>The chief cerebral conditions of perception are the paths
of association irradiating from the sense-impression, which
may have been already formed. If a certain sensation be
strongly associated with the attributes of a certain thing,
that thing is almost sure to be perceived when we get the
sensation. Examples of such things would be familiar
people, places, etc., which we recognize and name at a
glance. But <i>where the sensation is associated with more than
one reality</i>, so that either of two discrepant sets of residual
properties may arise, the perception is doubtful and
vacillating, and <i>the most that can then be said of it is that it
will be of a</i> <span class="smcap">probable</span> <i>thing</i>, of the thing which would most
usually have given us that sensation.</p>

<p>In these ambiguous cases it is interesting to note that
perception is rarely abortive; <i>some</i> perception takes place.
The two discrepant sets of associates do not neutralize each
other or mix and make a blur. What we more commonly
get is first one object in its completeness, and then the other
in its completeness. In other words, <i>all brain-processes are
such as give rise to what we may call</i> <span class="smcap">figured</span> <i>consciousness</i>. If
paths are irradiated at all, they are irradiated in consistent
systems, and occasion thoughts of definite objects, not mere
hodge-podges of elements. Even where the brain's functions
are half thrown out of gear, as in aphasia or dropping
asleep, this law of figured consciousness holds good. A
person who suddenly gets sleepy whilst reading aloud will
read wrong; but instead of emitting a mere broth of syllables,
he will make such mistakes as to read 'supper-time'
instead of 'sovereign,' 'overthrow' instead of 'opposite,'
or indeed utter entirely imaginary phrases, composed of
several definite words, instead of phrases of the book. So
in aphasia: where the disease is mild the patient's mistakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
consist in using entire wrong words instead of right
ones. Only in the gravest lesions does he become quite inarticulate.
These facts show how subtle is the associative
link; how delicate yet how strong that connection among
brain-paths which makes any number of them, once excited
together, thereafter tend to vibrate as a systematic whole. A
small group of elements, '<i>this</i>,' common to two systems, A
and B, may touch off A or B according as accident decides
the next step (see Fig. 47). If it happen that a single point
leading from '<i>this</i>' to B is momentarily a little more pervious
than any leading from '<i>this</i>' to A, then that little
advantage will upset the equilibrium in favor of the entire
system B. The currents will sweep first through that point
and thence into all the paths of B, each increment of advance
making A more and more impossible. The thoughts
correlated with A and B, in such a case, will have objects
different, though similar. The similarity will, however,
consist in some very limited feature if the 'this' be small.</p>

<p><i>Thus the faintest sensations will give rise to the perception
of definite things if only they resemble those which the things
are wont to arouse.</i> In fact, a sensation must be strong and
distinct in order not to suggest an object and, if it is a nondescript
feeling, really to seem one. The auræ of epilepsy,
globes of light, fiery vision, roarings in the ears, the sensations
which electric currents give rise to when passed through
the head, these are unfigured because they are strong.
Weaker feelings of the same sort would probably suggest
objects. Many years ago, after reading Maury's book, <i>Le
Sommeil et les Rêves</i>, I began for the first time to observe
those ideas which faintly flit through the mind at all times,
words, visions, etc., disconnected with the main stream of
thought, but discernible to an attention on the watch for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
them. A horse's head, a coil of rope, an anchor, are, for
example, ideas which have come to me unsolicited whilst I
have been writing these latter lines. They can often be
explained by subtle links of association, often not at all.
But I have not a few times been surprised, after noting
some such idea, to find, on shutting my eyes, an after-image
left on the retina by some bright or dark object
recently looked at, and which had evidently suggested
the idea. 'Evidently,' I say, because the general shape,
size, and position of object thought-of and of after-image
were the same, although the idea had details which the
retinal image lacked. We shall probably never know just
what part retinal after-images play in determining the train
of our thoughts. Judging by my own experiences I should
suspect it of being not insignificant.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<h4>ILLUSIONS.</h4>


<p>Let us now, for brevity's sake, treat A and B in Fig. 47
as if they stood for objects instead of brain-processes. And
let us furthermore suppose that A and B are, both of them,
objects which might probably excite the sensation which I
have called '<i>this</i>,' but that on the present occasion A and
not B is the one which actually does so. If, then, on this
occasion '<i>this</i>' suggests A and not B, the result is a <i>correct
perception</i>. But if, on the contrary, 'this' suggests B and
not A, the result is a <i>false perception</i>, or, as it is technically
called, an <i>illusion</i>. But the <i>process</i> is the same, whether
the perception be true or false.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Note that in every illusion what is false is what is inferred,
not what is immediately given. The 'this,' if it
were felt by itself alone, would be all right, it only becomes
misleading by what it suggests. If it is a sensation of
sight, it may suggest a tactile object, for example, which
later tactile experiences prove to be not there. <i>The so-called
'fallacy of the senses,' of which the ancient sceptics made so
much account, is not fallacy of the senses proper, but rather of
the intellect, which interprets wrongly what the senses give.</i><a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So much premised, let us look a little closer at these
illusions. They are due to two main causes. <i>The wrong
object is perceived either because</i></p>

<p>1) <i>Although not on this occasion the real cause, it is yet the
habitual, inveterate, or most probable cause of 'this;'</i> or because</p>

<p>2) <i>The mind is temporarily full of the thought of that object,
and therefore 'this' is peculiarly prone to suggest it at this
moment.</i></p>

<p>I will give briefly a number of examples under each
head. The first head is the more important, because it
includes a number of constant illusions to which all men
are subject, and which can only be dispelled by much
experience.</p>


<h4><i>Illusions of the First Type.</i></h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/fig_48.jpg" width="200" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 48.</div>
</div>

<p>One of the oldest instances dates from Aristotle. Cross
two fingers and roll a pea, pen-holder,
or other small object between
them. It will seem double.
Professor Croom Robertson has
given the clearest analysis of this
illusion. He observes that if
the object be brought into contact
first with the forefinger and next with the second finger,
the two contacts seem to come in at different points of space.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
The forefinger-touch seems higher, though the finger is
really lower; the second-finger-touch seems lower, though
the finger is really higher. "We perceive the contacts as
double because we refer them to two distinct parts of
space." The touched sides of the two fingers are normally
not together in space, and customarily never do touch one
thing; the one thing which now touches them, therefore,
seems in two places, i.e. seems two things.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>There is a whole batch of illusions which come from
optical sensations interpreted by us in accordance with our
usual rule, although they are now produced by an unusual
object. The <i>stereoscope</i> is an example. The eyes see a
picture apiece, and the two pictures are a little disparate,
the one seen by the right eye being a view of the object
taken from a point slightly to the right of that from which
the left eye's picture is taken. Pictures thrown on the two
eyes by solid objects present this identical disparity.
Whence we react on the sensation in our usual way, and
perceive a solid. If the pictures be exchanged we perceive
a hollow mould of the object, for a hollow mould would
cast just such disparate pictures as these. Wheatstone's
instrument, the <i>pseudoscope</i>, allows us to look at solid
objects and see with each eye the other eye's picture. We
then perceive the solid object hollow, <i>if it be an object which
might probably be hollow,</i> but not otherwise. A human face,
e.g., never appears hollow to the pseudoscope. In this
irregularity of reaction on different objects, some seem
hollow, others not; the perceptive process is true to its
law, which is <i>always to react on the sensation in a determinate
and figured fashion if possible, and in as probable
a fashion as the case admits</i>. To couple faces and hollowness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
violates all our habits of association. For the same
reason it is very easy to make an intaglio cast of a face, or
the painted inside of a pasteboard mask, look convex, instead
of concave as they are.</p>

<p>Our sense of the <i>position</i> of things with respect to our
eye consists in suggestions of how we must move our hand
to touch them. Certain places of the image on the retina,
certain actively-produced positions of the eyeballs, are
normally linked with the sense of every determinate position
which an outer thing may come to occupy. Hence we
perceive the usual position, even if the optical sensation be
artificially brought from a different part of space. Prisms
warp the light-rays in this way, and throw upon the retina
the image of an object situated, say, at spot <i>a</i> of space in the
same manner in which (without the prisms) an object situated
at spot <i>b</i> would cast its image. Accordingly we feel
for the object at <i>b</i> instead of <i>a</i>. If the prism be before one
eye only we see the object at <i>b</i> with that eye, and in its
right position <i>a</i> with the other&mdash;in other words, we see it
double. If both eyes be armed with prisms with their angle
towards the right, we pass our hand to the right of all objects
when we try rapidly to touch them. And this illusory
sense of their position lasts until a new association is fixed,
when on removing the prisms a contrary illusion at first
occurs. Passive or unintentional changes in the position
of the eyeballs seem to be no more kept account of by the
mind than prisms are; so we spontaneously make no allowance
for them in our perception of distance and movements.
Press one of the eyeballs into a strained position with the
finger, and objects move and are translocated accordingly,
just as when prisms are used.</p>

<p>Curious <i>illusions of movement</i> in objects occur whenever
the eyeballs move without our intending it. We shall learn
in the following chapter that the original visual feeling of
movement is produced by any image passing over the retina.
Originally, however, this sensation is definitely referred
neither to the object nor to the eyes. Such definite reference
grows up later, and obeys certain simple laws. We
believe objects to move: 1) whenever we get the retinal
movement-feeling, but think our eyes are still; and 2) whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
we think that our eyes move, but fail to get the retinal
movement-feeling. We believe objects to be still, on the
contrary, 1) whenever we get the retinal movement-feeling,
but think our eyes are moving; and 2) whenever we neither
think our eyes are moving, nor get the retinal movement-feeling.
Thus the perception of the object's state of motion
or rest depends on the notion we frame of our own eye's
movement. Now many sorts of stimulation make our eyes
move without our knowing it. If we look at a waterfall,
river, railroad train, or any body which continuously passes
in front of us in the same direction, it carries our eyes with
it. This movement can be noticed in our eyes by a bystander.
If the object keep passing towards our left, our
eyes keep following whatever moving bit of it may have
caught their attention at first, until that bit disappears
from view. Then they jerk back to the right again, and
catch a new bit, which again they follow to the left, and so
on indefinitely. This gives them an oscillating demeanor,
slow involuntary rotations leftward alternating with rapid
voluntary jerks rightward. But <i>the oscillations continue</i> for
a while after the object has come to a standstill, or the
eyes are carried to a new object, and this produces the illusion
that things now move in the opposite direction. For
we are unaware of the slow leftward automatic movements
of our eyeballs, and think that the retinal movement-sensations
thereby aroused must be due to a rightward motion
of the object seen; whilst the rapid voluntary rightward
movements of our eyeballs we interpret as attempts to pursue
and catch again those parts of the object which have
been slipping away to the left.</p>

<p>Exactly similar oscillations of the eyeballs are produced
in <i>giddiness</i>, with exactly similar results. Giddiness is easiest
produced by whirling on our heels. It is a feeling of
the movement of our own head and body through space,
and is now pretty well understood to be due to the irritation
of the semi-circular canals of the inner ear.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> When,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
after whirling, we stop, we seem to be spinning in the reverse
direction for a few seconds, and then objects appear to continue
whirling in the same direction in which, a moment
previous, our body actually whirled. The reason is that
our <i>eyes normally tend to maintain</i> their field of view. If we
suddenly turn our head leftwards it is hard to make the
eyes follow. They roll in their orbits rightwards, by a
sort of compensating inertia. Even though we <i>falsely
think</i> our head to be moving leftwards, this consequence
occurs, and our eyes move rightwards&mdash;as may be observed
in any one with vertigo after whirling. As these movements
are unconscious, the retinal movement-feelings which
they occasion are naturally referred to the objects seen.
And the intermittent voluntary twitches of the eyes towards
the left, by which we ever and anon recover them from the
extreme rightward positions to which the reflex movement
brings them, simply confirm and intensify our impression
of a leftward-whirling field of view: we seem to ourselves
to be periodically pursuing and overtaking the objects in
their leftward flight. The whole phenomenon fades out
after a few seconds. And it often ceases if we voluntarily
fix our eyes upon a given point.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><i>Optical vertigo,</i> as these illusions of objective movement
are called, results sometimes from brain-trouble, intoxications,
paralysis, etc. A man will awaken with a weakness
of one of his eye-muscles. An intended orbital rotation
will then not produce its expected result in the way of
retinal movement-feeling&mdash;whence false perceptions, of
which one of the most interesting cases will fall to be
discussed in later chapters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is an illusion of movement of the opposite sort,
with which every one is familiar at <i>railway stations</i>. Habitually,
when we ourselves move forward, our entire field of
view glides backward over our retina. When our movement
is due to that of the windowed carriage, car, or boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
in which we sit, all stationary objects visible through the
window give us a sensation of gliding in the opposite
direction. Hence, whenever we get this sensation, of a
window with <i>all</i> objects visible through it moving in one
direction, we react upon it in our customary way, and perceive
a stationary field of view, over which the window, and
we ourselves inside of it, are passing by a motion of our
own. Consequently when another train comes alongside
of ours in a station, and fills the entire window, and, after
standing still awhile, begins to glide away, we judge that it
is <i>our</i> train which is moving, and that the other train is still.
If, however, we catch a glimpse of any part of the station
through the windows, or between the cars, of the other train,
the illusion of our own movement instantly disappears, and
we perceive the other train to be the one in motion. This,
again, is but making the usual and probable inference from
our sensation.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><i>Another illusion due to movement</i> is explained by Helmholtz.
Most wayside objects, houses, trees, etc., look small
when seen out of the windows of a swift train. This is because
we perceive them in the first instance unduly near.
And we perceive them unduly near because of their extraordinarily
rapid parallactic flight backwards. When we
ourselves move forward all objects glide backwards, as
aforesaid; but the nearer they are, the more rapid is this
apparent translocation. Relative rapidity of passage backwards
is thus so familiarly associated with nearness that
when we feel it we perceive nearness. But with a given
size of retinal image the nearer an object is, the smaller do
we judge its actual size to be. Hence in the train, the
faster we go, the nearer do the trees and houses seem, and
the nearer they seem, the smaller do they look.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Other illusions are due to the feeling of convergence</i> being
wrongly interpreted. When we converge our eyeballs we
perceive an <i>approximation</i> of whatever thing we may be
looking at. Whatever things do approach whilst we look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
at them oblige us, so long as they are not very distant, to
converge our eyes. Hence approach of the thing is the <i>probable</i>
objective fact when we feel our eyes converging. Now in
most persons the internal recti muscles, to which convergence
is due, are weaker than the others; and the entirely
passive position of the eyeballs, the position which they
assume when covered and looking at nothing in particular,
is either that of parallelism or of slight divergence. Make
a person look with both eyes at some near object, and then
screen the object from <i>one</i> of his eyes by a card or book.
The chances are that you will see the eye thus screened
turn just a little outwards. Remove the screen, and you
will now see it turn in as it catches sight of the object again.
The other eye meanwhile keeps as it was at first. To most
persons, accordingly, all objects seem to <i>come nearer</i> when,
after looking at them with one eye, both eyes are used;
and they seem to <i>recede</i> during the opposite change. With
persons whose external recti muscles are insufficient, the
illusions may be of the contrary kind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The size of the retinal image</i> is a fruitful source of illusions.
Normally, the retinal image grows larger as the object draws
near. But the sensation yielded by this enlargement is
also given by any object which really grows in size without
changing its distance. Enlargement of retinal image
is therefore an ambiguous sign. An opera-glass enlarges
the moon. But most persons will tell you that she looks
smaller through it, only a great deal nearer and brighter.
They read the enlargement as a sign of approach; and the
perception of approach makes them actually reverse the
sensation which suggests it&mdash;by an exaggeration of our
habitual custom of making allowance of the apparent enlargement
of whatever object approaches us, and reducing
it in imagination to its natural size. Similarly, in the theatre
the glass brings the stage near, but hardly seems to magnify
the people on it.</p>

<p>The well-known increased <i>apparent size of the moon on the
horizon</i> is a result of association and probability. It is seen
through vaporous air, and looks dimmer and duskier than
when it rides on high; and it is seen over fields, trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
hedges, streams, and the like, which break up the intervening
space and make us the better realize the latter's extent.
Both these causes make the moon seem more distant from
us when it is low; and as its visual angle grows no less, we
deem that it must be a larger body, and we so perceive it.
It looks particularly enormous when it comes up directly
behind some well-known large object, as a house or tree,
distant enough to subtend an angle no larger than that of
the moon itself.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The feeling of accommodation</i> also gives rise to false perceptions
of size. Usually we accommodate our eyes for an
object as it approaches us. Usually under these circumstances
the object throws a larger retinal image. But
believing the object to remain the same, we make allowance
for this and treat the entire eye-feeling which we receive
as significant of nothing but <i>approach</i>. When we relax our
accommodation and at the same time the retinal image
grows smaller, the probable cause is always a <i>receding</i>
object. The moment we put on convex glasses, however,
the accommodation relaxes, but the retinal image grows
larger instead of less. This is what would happen if our
object, whilst receding, grew. Such a probable object we
accordingly perceive, though with a certain vacillation as
to the recession, for the growth in apparent size is also a
probable sign of approach, and is at moments interpreted
accordingly.&mdash;Atropin paralyzes the muscles of accommodation.
It is possible to get a dose which will weaken
these muscles without laming them altogether. When a
known near object is then looked at we have to make the
same voluntary strain to accommodate, as if it were a great
deal nearer; but as its retinal image is not enlarged in proportion
to this suggested approach, we deem that it must
have grown smaller than usual. In consequence of this
so-called <i>micropsy</i>, Aubert relates that he saw a man apparently
no larger than a photograph. But the small size
again made the man seem farther off. The real distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
was two or three feet, and he seemed against the wall of
the room.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Of these vacillations we shall have to speak
again in the ensuing chapter.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<img src="images/fig_49.jpg" width="40" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 49.</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. C. L. Franklin has recently described and explained
with rare acuteness an illusion of which the most curious
thing is that it was never noticed before. Take a single
pair of crossed lines (Fig. 49), hold them in a horizontal plane
before the eyes, and look along them, at such a
distance that with the right eye shut, 1, and with
the left eye shut, 2, looks like the projection of a
vertical line. Look steadily now at the point of
intersection of the lines with both eyes open, and
you will see a third line sticking up like a pin
through the paper at right angles to the plane of the
two first lines. The explanation of this illusion is
very simple, but so circumstantial that I must refer for it to
Mrs. Franklin's own account.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Suffice it that images of the
two lines fall on 'corresponding' rows of retinal points,
and that the illusory vertical line is the only object capable
of throwing such images. A variation of the experiment
is this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In Fig. 50 the lines are all drawn so as to pass through a common
point. With a little trouble one eye can be put into the position of this
point&mdash;it is only necessary that the paper be held so that, with one eye
shut, the other eye sees all the lines leaning neither to the right nor to
the left. After a moment one can fancy the lines to be vertical staffs
standing out of the plane of the paper.'... This illusion [says Mrs.
Franklin] I take to be of purely mental origin. When a line lies anywhere
in a plane passing through the apparent vertical meridian of one
eye, and is looked at with that eye only... we have no very good
means of knowing how it is directed in that plane.... Now of the
lines in nature which lie anywhere within such a plane, by far the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
greater number are vertical lines. Hence we are peculiarly inclined to
think that a line which we perceive to be in such a plane is a vertical
line. But to see a whole lot of lines at once, all ready to throw their images
upon the vertical meridian, is a thing that has hardly ever happened to
us, except when they all have been vertical lines. Hence when that
happens we have a still stronger tendency to think that what we see
before us is a group of vertical lines."</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/fig_50.jpg" width="300" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 50.</div>
</div>

<p>In other words, we see, as always, the most probable
object.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing may serve as examples of the first type
of illusions mentioned on <a href="#Page_86">page 86</a>. I could cite of course
many others, but it would be tedious to enumerate all the
thaumatropes and zoetropes, dioramas, and juggler's tricks
in which they are embodied. In the chapter on Sensation
we saw that many illusions commonly ranged under this
type are, physiologically considered, of another sort altogether,
and that associative processes, strictly so called,
have nothing to do with their production.</p>


<h4><i>Illusions of the Second Type.</i></h4>


<p>We may now turn to illusions of the second of the two
types discriminated on <a href="#Page_86">page 86</a>. In this type we perceive a
wrong object because our mind is full of the thought of it
at the time, and any sensation which is in the least degree
connected with it touches off, as it were, a train already
laid, and gives us a sense that the object is really before
us. Here is a familiar example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If a sportsman, while shooting woodcock in cover, sees a bird
about the size and color of a woodcock get up and fly through the foliage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
not having time to see more than that it is a bird of such a size
and color, he immediately supplies by inference the other qualities of a
woodcock, and is afterwards disgusted to find that he has shot a thrush.
I have done so myself, and could hardly believe that the thrush was the
bird I had fired at, so complete was my mental supplement to my visual
perception."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As with game, so with enemies, ghosts, and the like.
Anyone waiting in a dark place and expecting or fearing
strongly a certain object will interpret any abrupt sensation
to mean that object's presence. The boy playing 'I
spy,' the criminal skulking from his pursuers, the superstitious
person hurrying through the woods or past the churchyard
at midnight, the man lost in the woods, the girl who
tremulously has made an evening appointment with her
swain, all are subject to illusions of sight and sound which
make their hearts beat till they are dispelled. Twenty
times a day the lover, perambulating the streets with his
preoccupied fancy, will think he perceives his idol's bonnet
before him.</p>

<p><i>The Proof-reader's Illusion</i>. I remember one night in
Boston, whilst waiting for a 'Mount Auburn' car to bring
me to Cambridge, reading most distinctly that name upon
the signboard of a car on which (as I afterwards learned)
'North Avenue' was painted. The illusion was so vivid
that I could hardly believe my eyes had deceived me. All
reading is more or less performed in this way.</p>

<p>"Practised novel- or newspaper-readers could not possibly get on so
fast if they had to see accurately every single letter of every word in
order to perceive the words. More than half of the words come out of
their mind, and hardly half from the printed page. Were this not so,
did we perceive each letter by itself, typographic errors in well-known
words would never be overlooked. Children, whose ideas are not yet
ready enough to perceive words at a glance, read them wrong if they
are printed wrong, that is, right according to the way of printing. In
a foreign language, although it may be printed with the same letters,
we read by so much the more slowly as we do not understand, or are
unable promptly to perceive the words. But we notice misprints all the
more readily. For this reason Latin and Greek and, still better,
Hebrew works are more correctly printed, because the proofs are better
corrected, than in German works. Of two friends of mine, one knew
much Hebrew, the other little; the latter, however, gave instruction in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Hebrew in a gymnasium; and when he called the other to help correct
his pupils' exercises, it turned out that he could find out all sorts of
little errors better than his friend, because the latter's perception of the
words as totals was too swift."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Testimony to personal identity is proverbially fallacious</i> for
similar reasons. A man has witnessed a rapid crime or
accident, and carries away his mental image. Later he is
confronted by a prisoner whom he forthwith perceives in
the light of that image, and recognizes or 'identifies' as a
participant, although he may never have been near the
spot. Similarly at the so-called 'materializing séances'
which fraudulent mediums give: in a dark room a man
sees a gauze-robed figure who in a whisper tells him she is
the spirit of his sister, mother, wife, or child, and falls upon
his neck. The darkness, the previous forms, and the expectancy
have so filled his mind with premonitory images
that it is no wonder he perceives what is suggested. These
fraudulent 'séances' would furnish most precious documents
to the psychology of perception, if they could only
be satisfactorily inquired into. In the hypnotic trance any
suggested object is sensibly perceived. In certain subjects
this happens more or less completely after waking from
the trance. It would seem that under favorable conditions
a somewhat similar susceptibility to suggestion may exist
in certain persons who are not otherwise entranced at all.</p>

<p>This suggestibility is greater in the lower senses than
in the higher. A German observer writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We know that a weak smell or taste may be very diversely interpreted
by us, and that the same sensation will now be named as one
thing and the next moment as another. Suppose an agreeable smell of
flowers in a room: A visitor will notice it, seek to recognize what it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and at last perceive more and more distinctly that it is the perfume of
roses&mdash;until after all he discovers a bouquet of violets. Then suddenly
he recognizes the violet-smell, and wonders how he could possibly have
hit upon the roses.&mdash;Just so it is with taste. Try some meat whose
visible characteristics are disguised by the mode of cooking, and you
will perhaps begin by taking it for venison, and end by being quite
certain that it is venison, until you are told that it is mutton; whereupon
you get distinctly the mutton flavor.&mdash;In this wise one may make
a person taste or smell what one will, if one only makes sure that he
shall conceive it beforehand as we wish, by saying to him: 'Doesn't
that taste just like, etc.?' or 'Doesn't it smell just like, etc.?' One
can cheat whole companies in this way; announce, for instance, at a
meal, that the meat tastes 'high,' and almost every one who is not
animated by a spirit of opposition will discover a flavor of putrescence
which in reality is not there at all.</p>

<p>"In the sense of <i>feeling</i> this phenomenon is less prominent, because
we get so close to the object that our sensation of it is never incomplete.
Still, examples may be adduced from this sense. On superficially feeling
of a cloth, one may confidently declare it for velvet, whilst it is
perhaps a long-haired cloth; or a person may perhaps not be able to
decide whether he has put on woolen or cotton stockings, and, trying
to ascertain this by the feeling on the skin of the feet, he may become
aware that he gets the feeling of cotton or wool according as he thinks
of the one or the other. When the feeling in our fingers is somewhat
blunted by cold, we notice many such phenomena, being then more exposed
to confound objects of touch with one another."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>High authorities have doubted this power of imagination
to falsify present impressions of sense.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Yet it unquestionably
exists. Within the past fortnight I have been annoyed
by a smell, faint but unpleasant, in my library. My annoyance
began by an escape of gas from the furnace below
stairs. This seemed to get lodged in my imagination as a
sort of standard of perception; for, several days after the
furnace had been rectified, I perceived the 'same smell'
again. It was traced this time to a new pair of India rubber
shoes which had been brought in from the shop and laid on
a table. It persisted in coming to me for several days,
however, in spite of the fact that no other member of the
family or visitor noticed anything unpleasant. My impression
during part of this time was one of uncertainty whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the smell was imaginary or real; and at last it faded out.
Everyone must be able to give instances like this from the
smell-sense. When we have paid the faithless plumber for
pretending to mend our drains, the intellect inhibits the
nose from perceiving the same unaltered odor, until perhaps
several days go by. As regards the ventilation or
heating of rooms, we are apt to feel for some time as we
think we ought to feel. If we believe the ventilator is shut,
we feel the room close. On discovering it open, the oppression
disappears.</p>

<p>An extreme instance is given in the following extract:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A patient called at my office one day in a state of great excitement
from the effects of an offensive odor in the horse-car she had come in,
and which she declared had probably emanated from some very sick
person who must have been just carried in it. There could be no doubt
that something had affected her seriously, for she was very pale, with
nausea, difficulty in breathing, and other evidences of bodily and mental
distress. I succeeded, after some difficulty and time, in quieting her,
and she left, protesting that the smell was unlike anything she had ever
before experienced and was something dreadful. Leaving my office
soon after, it so happened that I found her at the street-corner, waiting
for a car: we thus entered the car together. She immediately called
my attention to the same sickening odor which she had experienced in
the other car, and began to be affected the same as before, when I
pointed out to her that the smell was simply that which always emanates
from the straw which has been in stables. She quickly recognized it as
the same, when the unpleasant effects which arose while she was possessed
with another perception of its character at once passed away."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is the same with touch. Everyone must have felt the
sensible quality change under his hand, as sudden contact
with something moist or hairy, in the dark, awoke a shock
of disgust or fear which faded into calm recognition of some
familiar object? Even so small a thing as a crumb of potato
on the table-cloth, which we pick up, thinking it a
crumb of bread, feels horrible for a few moments to our
fancy, and different from what it is.</p>

<p>Weight or muscular feeling is a sensation; yet who has
not heard the anecdote of some one to whom Sir Humphry
Davy showed the metal sodium which he had just discovered?
"Bless me, how heavy it is!" said the man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
showing that his idea of what metals as a class ought to be
had falsified the sensation he derived from a very light
substance.</p>

<p>In the sense of hearing, similar mistakes abound. I
have already mentioned the hallucinatory effect of mental
images of very faint sounds, such as distant clock-strokes
(above, <a href="#Page_71">p. 71</a>). But even when stronger sensations of sound
have been present, everyone must recall some experience
in which they have altered their acoustic character as soon
as the intellect referred them to a different source. The
other day a friend was sitting in my room, when the clock,
which has a rich low chime, began to strike. "Hollo!" said
he, "hear that hand-organ in the garden," and was surprised
at finding the real source of the sound. I had myself
some years ago a very striking illusion of the sort. Sitting
reading late one night, I suddenly heard a most formidable
noise proceeding from the upper part of the house, which
it seemed to fill. It ceased, and in a moment renewed itself.
I went into the hall to listen, but it came no more.
Resuming my seat in the room, however, there it was again,
low, mighty, alarming, like a rising flood or the <i>avant-courier</i>
of an awful gale. It came from all space. Quite
startled, I again went into the hall, but it had already
ceased once more. On returning a second time to the room,
I discovered that it was nothing but the breathing of a little
Scotch terrier which lay asleep on the floor. The noteworthy
thing is that as soon as I recognized what it was, I
was compelled to think it a different sound, and could not
then <i>hear</i> it as I had heard it a moment before.</p>

<p>In the anecdotes given by Delbœuf and Reid, this was
probably also the case, though it is not so stated. Reid
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I remember that once lying abed, and having been put into a fright,
I heard my own heart beat; but I took it to be one knocking at the
door, and arose and opened the door oftener than once, before I discovered
that the sound was in my own breast." (Inquiry, chap. iv.
§ 1.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Delbœuf's story is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The illustrious P. J. van Beneden, senior, was walking one evening
with a friend along a woody hill near Chaudfontaine. 'Don't you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
hear,' said the friend, 'the noise of a hunt on the mountain?' M. van
Beneden listens and distinguishes in fact the giving-tongue of the dogs.
They listen some time, expecting from one moment to another to see a
deer bound by; but the voice of the dogs seems neither to recede nor
approach. At last a countryman comes by, and they ask him who it is
that can be hunting at this late hour. But he, pointing to some puddles
of water near their feet, replies: 'Yonder little animals are what you
hear.' And there there were in fact a number of toads of the species
<i>Bombinator igneus</i>.... This batrachian emits at the pairing season a
silvery or rather crystalline note.... Sad and pure, it is a voice in
nowise resembling that of hounds giving chase."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The sense of sight, as we have seen in studying Space,
is pregnant with illusions of both the types considered.
No sense gives such fluctuating impressions of the same
object as sight does. With no sense are we so apt to treat
the sensations immediately given as mere signs; with none
is the invocation from memory of a <i>thing</i>, and the consequent
perception of the latter, so immediate. The 'thing'
which we perceive always resembles, as we have seen, the
object of some absent sensation, usually another optical
figure which in our mind has come to be the standard of
reality; and it is this incessant reduction of our optical
objects to more 'real' forms which has led some authors
into the mistake of thinking that the sensations which
first apprehend them are originally and natively of no
form at all.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Of accidental and occasional illusions of sight many
amusing examples might be given. Two will suffice. One
is a reminiscence of my own. I was lying in my berth in
a steamer listening to the sailors holystone the deck outside;
when, on turning my eyes to the window, I perceived
with perfect distinctness that the chief-engineer of the vessel
had entered my state-room, and was standing looking
through the window at the men at work upon the guards.
Surprised at his intrusion, and also at his intentness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
immobility, I remained watching him and wondering how
long he would stand thus. At last I spoke; but getting no
reply, sat up in my berth, and then saw that what I had
taken for the engineer was my own cap and coat hanging
on a peg beside the window. The illusion was complete;
the engineer was a peculiar-looking man; and I saw him
unmistakably; but after the illusion had vanished I found
it hard voluntarily to make the cap and coat look like him
at all.</p>

<p>The following story, which I owe to my friend Prof.
Hyatt, is of a probably not uncommon class:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"During the winter of 1858, while in Venice, I had the somewhat
peculiar illusion which you request me to relate. I remember the circumstances
very accurately because I have often repeated the story,
and have made an effort to keep all the attendant circumstances clear
of exaggeration. I was travelling with my mother, and we had taken
rooms at a hotel which had been located in an old palace. The room
in which I went to bed was large and lofty. The moon was shining
brightly, and I remember standing before a draped window, thinking
of the romantic nature of the surroundings, remnants of old stories of
knights and ladies, and the possibility that even in that room itself
love-scenes and sanguinary tragedies might have taken place. The
night was so lovely that many of the people were strolling through the
narrow lanes or so-called streets, singing as they went, and I laid awake
for some time listening to these patrols of serenaders, and of course
finally fell asleep. I became aware that some one was leaning over me
closely, and that my own breathing was being interfered with; a decided
feeling of an unwelcome presence of some sort awakened me. As I
opened my eyes I saw, as distinctly as I ever saw any living person, a
draped head about a foot or eighteen inches to the right, and just above
my bed. The horror which took possession of my young fancy was
beyond anything I have ever experienced. The head was covered by a
long black veil which floated out into the moonlight, the face itself was
pale and beautiful, and the lower part swathed in the white band commonly
worn by the nuns of Catholic orders. My hair seemed to rise
up, and a profuse perspiration attested the genuineness of the terror
which I felt. For a time I lay in this way, and then gradually gaining
more command over my superstitious terrors, concluded to try to grapple
with the apparition. It remained perfectly distinct until I reached
at it sharply with my hand, and then disappeared, to return again,
however, as soon as I sank back into the pillow. The second or third
grasp which I made at the head was not followed by a reappearance,
and I then saw that the ghost was not a real presence, but depended
upon the position of my head. If I moved my eyes either to the left or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
right of the original position occupied by my head when I awakened, the
ghost disappeared, and by returning to about the same position, I could
make it reappear with nearly the same intensity as at first. I presently
satisfied myself by these experiments that the illusion arose from the
effect of the imagination, aided by the actual figure made by a visual
section of the moonbeams shining through the lace curtains of the window.
If I had given way to the first terror of the situation and covered
up my head, I should probably have believed in the reality of the
apparition, since I have not by the slightest word, so far as I know, exaggerated
the vividness of my feelings."</p></blockquote>


<h4>THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS IN PERCEPTION.</h4>


<p>Enough, has now been said to prove the general law of
perception, which is this, that <i>whilst part of what we perceive
comes through our senses from the object before us, another
part</i> (and it may be the larger part) <i>always comes</i> (in Lazarus's
phrase) <i>out of our own head</i>.</p>

<p>At bottom this is only one case (and that the simplest
case) of the general fact that our nerve-centres are an organ
for reacting on sense-impressions, and that our hemispheres,
in particular, are given us in order that records of our private
past experience may co-operate in the reaction. Of course
such a general way of stating the fact is vague; and all those
who follow the current theory of ideas will be prompt to
throw this vagueness at it as a reproach. Their way of describing
the process goes much more into detail. The sensation,
they say, awakens 'images' of other sensations associated
with it in the past. These images 'fuse,' or are 'combined'
by the Ego with the present sensation into a new
product, the percept, etc., etc. Something so indistinguishable
from this in practical outcome is what really occurs,
that one may seem fastidious in objecting to such a statement,
specially if have no rival theory of the elementary
processes to propose. And yet, if this notion of images
rising and flocking and fusing <i>be</i> mythological (and we have
all along so considered it), why should we entertain it unless
confessedly as a mere figure of speech? As such, of course,
it is convenient and welcome to pass. But if we try to put
an exact meaning into it, all we find is that the brain reacts
by paths which previous experiences have worn, and makes
us usually perceive the probable thing, i.e., the thing by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
which on previous occasions the reaction was most frequently
aroused.</p>

<p>But we can, I think, without danger of being too
speculative, be a little more exact than this, and conceive
of a physiological reason why the felt quality of an object
changes when, instead of being apprehended in a mere sensation,
the object is perceived as a thing. All consciousness
seems to depend on a certain slowness of the process in the
cortical cells. The rapider currents are, the less feeling
they seem to awaken. If a region A, then, be so connected
with another region B that every current which enters A
immediately drains off into B, we shall not be very strongly
conscious of the sort of object that A can make us feel.
If B, on the contrary, has no such copious channel of discharge,
the excitement will linger there longer ere it diffuses
itself elsewhere, and our consciousness of the sort of object
that B makes us feel will be strong. Carrying this to
an ideal maximum, we may say that if A offer <i>no</i> resistance
to the transmission forward of the current, and if the current
<i>terminate</i> in B, then, no matter what causes may initiate
the current, we shall get no consciousness of the object
peculiar to A, but on the contrary a vivid sensation of the
object peculiar to B. And this will be true though at other
times the connection between A and B might lie less open,
and every current <i>then</i> entering A might give us a strong consciousness
of A's peculiar object. In other words, just in
proportion as associations are habitual, will the qualities of
the suggested thing tend to substitute themselves in consciousness
for those of the thing immediately there; or,
more briefly, <i>just in proportion as an experience is probable
will it tend to be directly felt.</i> In all such experiences the
paths lie wide open from the cells first affected to those
concerned with the suggested ideas. A circular after-image
on the receding wall or ceiling is actually <i>seen</i> as an ellipse,
a square after-image of a cross there is seen as slant-legged,
etc., because only in the process correlated with the vision
of the latter figures do the inward currents find a pause
(see the next chapter).</p>

<p>We must remember this when, in dealing with the eye,
we come to point out the erroneousness of the principle laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
down by Reid and Helmholtz that true sensations can
never be changed by the suggestions of experience.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A certain illusion of which I have not yet spoken affords
an additional illustration of this. <i>When we will to execute a
movement and the movement for some reason does not occur,
unless the sensation of the part's</i> <span class="smcap">not</span> <i>moving is a strong one, we
are apt to feel as if the movement had actually taken place.</i>
This seems habitually to be the case in anæsthesia of the
moving parts. Close the patient's eyes, hold his anæsthetic
arm still, and tell him to raise his hand to his head; and
when he opens his eyes he will be astonished to find that
the movement has not taken place. All reports of anæsthetic
cases seem to mention this illusion. Sternberg who wrote on
the subject in 1885,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> lays it down as a law that the intention
to move is the same thing as the feeling of the motion. We
shall later see that this is false (<a href="#CHAPTER_XXV395">Chapter XXV</a>); but it
certainly may <i>suggest</i> the feeling of the motion with hallucinatory
intensity. Sternberg gives the following experiment,
which I find succeeds with at least half of those who
try it: Rest your palm on the edge of the table with your
forefinger hanging over in a position of extreme flexion,
and then exert your will to flex it still more. The position
of the other fingers makes this impossible, and yet if we do
not look to see the finger, we think we feel it move. He
quotes from Exner a similar experiment with the jaws: Put
some hard rubber or other unindentable obstacle between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
your back teeth and bite hard: you think you feel the jaw
move and the front teeth approach each other, though in
the nature of things no movement can occur.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>&mdash;The visual
suggestion of the path traversed by the finger-tip as the
<i>locus</i> of the movement-feeling in the joint, which we discussed
on <a href="#Page_41">page 41</a>, is another example of this semi-hallucinatory
power of the suggested thing. Amputated people,
as we have learned, still feel their lost feet, etc. This is a
necessary consequence of the law of specific energies, for if
the central region correlated with the foot give rise to any
feeling at all it must give rise to the feeling of a foot.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> But
the curious thing is that many of these patients can <i>will the
foot to move</i>, and when they have done so, distinctly <i>feel the
movement to occur</i>. They can, to use their own language,
'work' or 'wiggle' their lost toes.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Now in all these various cases we are dealing with data
which in normal life are inseparably joined. Of all possible
experiences, it is hard to imagine any pair more uniformly
and incessantly coupled than the volition to move,
on the one hand, and the feeling of the changed position of
the parts, on the other. From the earliest ancestors of ours
which had feet, down to the present day, the movement of
the feet must always have accompanied the will to move
them; and here, if anywhere, habit's consequences ought
to be found. The process of the willing ought, then, to pour
into the process of feeling the command effected, and ought
to awaken that feeling in a maximal degree provided no
other positively contradictory sensation come in at the same
time. In most of us, when the will fails of its effect there
is a contradictory sensation. We discern a resistance or
the unchanged position of the limb. But neither in anæsthesia
nor in amputation can there be any contradictory
sensation in the foot to correct us; so imagination has all
the force of fact.</p>

<h4>'APPERCEPTION.'</h4>


<p>In Germany since Herbart's time Psychology has always
had a great deal to say about a process called <i>Apperception</i>.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
The incoming ideas or sensations are said to be 'apperceived'
by 'masses' of ideas already in the mind. It is plain
that the process we have been describing as perception is,
at this rate, an apperceptive process. So are all recognition,
classing, and naming; and passing beyond these simplest
suggestions, all farther thoughts about our percepts are
apperceptive processes as well. I have myself not used the
word apperception because it has carried very different meanings
in the history of philosophy,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and 'psychic reaction,'
'interpretation,' 'conception,' 'assimilation,' 'elaboration,'
or simply 'thought,' are perfect synonyms for its Herbartian
meaning, widely taken. It is, moreover, hardly worth while
to pretend to analyze the so-called apperceptive performances
beyond the first or perceptive stage, because their variations
and degrees are literally innumerable. 'Apperception'
is a name for the sum-total of the effects of what we have
studied as association; and it is obvious that the things
which a given experience will suggest to a man depend on
what Mr. Lewes calls his entire psychostatical conditions,
his nature and stock of ideas, or, in other words, his character,
habits, memory, education, previous experience, and
momentary mood. We gain no insight into what really occurs
either in the mind or in the brain by calling all these
things the 'apperceiving mass,' though of course this may
upon occasion be convenient. On the whole I am inclined
to think Mr. Lewes's term of 'assimilation' the most fruitful

<p>Professor H. Steinthal has analyzed apperceptive processes
with a sort of detail which is simply burdensome.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
His introduction of the matter may, however, be quoted.
He begins with an anecdote from a comic paper.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the compartment of a railway-carriage six persons unknown to
each other sit in lively conversation. It becomes a matter of regret that
one of the company must alight at the next station. One of the others
says that he of all things prefers such a meeting with entirely unknown
persons, and that on such occasions he is accustomed neither to ask who
or what his companions may be nor to tell who or what he is. Another
thereupon says that he will undertake to decide this question, if they
each and all will answer him an entirely disconnected question. They
began. He drew five leaves from his note-book, wrote a question on
each, and gave one to each of his companions with the request that he
write the answer below. When the leaves were returned to him, he
turned, after reading them, without hesitation to the others, and said to
the first, 'You are a man of science'; to the second, 'You are a soldier';
to the third, 'You are a philologer'; to the fourth, 'You are a
journalist'; to the fifth, 'You are a farmer.' All admitted that he
was right, whereupon he got out and left the five behind. Each
wished to know what question the others had received; and behold, he
had given the same question to each. It ran thus:</p>

<p>"'What being destroys what it has itself brought forth?'</p>

<p>"To this the naturalist had answered, 'vital force'; the soldier,
'war'; the philologist, 'Kronos'; the publicist, 'revolution'; the
farmer, 'a boar'. This anecdote, methinks, if not true, is at least
splendidly well invented. Its narrator makes the journalist go on to
say: 'Therein consists the joke. Each one answers the first thing that
occurs to him,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and that is whatever is most newly related to his pursuit
in life. Every question is a hole-drilling experiment, and the answer
is an opening through which one sees into our interiors.'... So
do we all. We are all able to recognize the clergyman, the soldier, the
scholar, the business man, not only by the cut of their garments and
the attitude of their body, but by what they say and how they express
it. We guess the place in life of men by the interest which they show
and the way in which they show it, by the objects of which they speak,
by the point of view from which they regard things, judge them, conceive
them, in short by their mode of <i>apperceiving</i>....</p>

<p>"Every man has one group of ideas which relate to his own person
and interests, and another which is connected with society. Each has
his group of ideas about plants, religion, law, art, etc., and more
especially about the rose, epic poetry, sermons, free trade, and the like.
Thus the mental content of every individual, even of the uneducated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and of children, consists of masses or circles of knowledge of which
each lies within some larger circle, alongside of others similarly included,
and of which each includes smaller circles within itself....
The perception of a thing like a horse... is a process between the
present horse's picture before our eyes, on the one hand, and those fused
or interwoven pictures and ideas of all the horses we have ever seen, on
the other;... a process between two factors or momenta, of which
one existed before the process and was an old possession of the mind
(the group of ideas, or concept, namely), whilst the other is but just
presented to the mind, and is the immediately supervening factor (the
sense-impression). The former apperceives the latter; the latter is
apperceived by the former. Out of their combination an apperception-product
arises: the knowledge of the perceived being as a horse. The
earlier factor is relatively to the later one active and <i>a priori</i>; the supervening
factor is given, <i>a posteriori</i>, passive.... We may then define
Apperception as the movement of two masses of consciousness (Vorstellungsmassen)
against each other so as to produce a cognition.</p>

<p>"The <i>a priori</i> factor we called active, the <i>a posteriori</i> factor passive,
but this is only relatively true.... Although the <i>a priori</i> moment
commonly shows itself to be the more powerful, apperception-processes
can perfectly well occur in which the new observation transforms or enriches
the apperceiving group of ideas. A child who hitherto has seen
none but four-cornered tables apperceives a round one as a table; but
by this the apperceiving mass ('table') is enriched. To his previous
knowledge of tables comes this new feature that they need not be four-cornered,
but may be round. In the history of science it has happened
often enough that some discovery, at the same time that it was apperceived,
i.e. brought into connection with the system of our knowledge,
transformed the whole system. In principle, however, we must maintain
that, although either factor is both active and passive, the <i>a priori</i> factor
is almost always the more active of the two."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This account of Steinthal's brings out very clearly the
<i>difference between our psychological conceptions and what are
called concepts in logic</i>. In logic a concept is unalterable; but
what are popularly called our 'conceptions of things' alter
by being used. The aim of 'Science' is to attain conceptions
so adequate and exact that we shall never need to
change them. There is an everlasting struggle in every
mind between the tendency to keep unchanged, and the
tendency to renovate, its ideas. Our education is a ceaseless
compromise between the conservative and the progressive
factors. Every new experience must be disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of under <i>some</i> old head. The great point is to find the head
which has to be least altered to take it in. Certain Polynesian
natives, seeing horses for the first time, called them
pigs, that being the nearest head. My child of two played
for a week with the first orange that was given him, calling
it a 'ball.' He called the first whole eggs he saw 'potatoes,'
having been accustomed to see his 'eggs' broken into a
glass, and his potatoes without the skin. A folding pocket-corkscrew
he unhesitatingly called 'bad-scissors.' Hardly
any one of us can make new heads easily when fresh experiences
come. Most of us grow more and more enslaved to
the stock conceptions with which we have once become
familiar, and less and less capable of assimilating impressions
in any but the old ways. Old-fogyism, in short, is the
inevitable terminus to which life sweeps us on. Objects
which violate our established habits of 'apperception' are
simply not taken account of at all; or, if on some occasion
we are forced by dint of argument to admit their existence,
twenty-four hours later the admission is as if it were not,
and every trace of the unassimilable truth has vanished
from our thought. Genius, in truth, means little more than
the faculty of perceiving in an unhabitual way.</p>

<p>On the other hand, nothing is more congenial, from
babyhood to the end of life, than to be able to assimilate
the new to the old, to meet each threatening violator or
burster of our well-known series of concepts, as it comes
in, see through its unwontedness, and ticket it off as an old
friend in disguise. This victorious assimilation of the new
is in fact the type of all intellectual pleasure. The lust for
it is curiosity. The relation of the new to the old, before
the assimilation is performed, is wonder. We feel neither
curiosity nor wonder concerning things so far beyond us
that we have no concepts to refer them to or standards by
which to measure them.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The Fuegians, in Darwin's voyage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
wondered at the small boats, but took the big ship as
a 'matter of course.' Only what we partly know already
inspires us with a desire to know more. The more elaborate
textile fabrics, the vaster works in metal, to most of
us are like the air, the water, and the ground, absolute existences
which awaken no ideas. It is a matter of course
that an engraving or a copper-plate inscription should possess
that degree of beauty. But if we are shown a <i>pen</i>-drawing
of equal perfection, our personal sympathy with
the difficulty of the task makes us immediately wonder at
the skill. The old lady admiring the Academician's picture,
says to him: "And is it really all done <i>by hand</i>?"</p>


<h4>IS PERCEPTION UNCONSCIOUS INFERENCE?</h4>


<p>A widely-spread opinion (which has been held by such
men as Schopenhauer, Spencer, Hartmann, Wundt, Helmholtz,
and lately interestingly pleaded for by M. Binet)<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
will have it that <i>perception should be called a sort of reasoning
operation, more or less unconsciously and automatically performed</i>.
The question seems at first a verbal one, depending
on how broadly the term reasoning is to be taken. If,
every time a present sign suggests an absent reality to our
mind, we make an inference; and if every time we make an
inference we reason; then perception is indubitably reasoning.
Only one sees no room in it for any unconscious part.
Both associates, the present sign and the contiguous things
which it suggests, are above-board, and no intermediary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
ideas are required. Most of those who have upheld the
thesis in question have, however, made a more complex
supposition. What they have meant is that perception is
a <i>mediate</i> inference, and that the middle term is unconscious.
When the sensation which I have called 'this' (<a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a>, <i>supra</i>)
is felt, they think that some process like the following runs
through the mind:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'This' is M;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">but M is A;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">therefore 'this' is A.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Now there seem no good grounds for supposing this
additional wheelwork in the mind. The classification of
'<i>this</i>' as M is itself an act of perception, and should, if all
perception were inference, require a still earlier syllogism for
its performance, and so backwards <i>in infinitum</i>. The only
extrication from this coil would be to represent the process
in altered guise, thus:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'This' is <i>like those</i>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Those</i> are A;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Therefore 'this' is A.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The major premise here involves no association by contiguity,
no <i>naming</i> of <i>those</i> as M, but only a suggestion of
unnamed similar images, a recall of analogous past sensations
with which the characters that make up A were habitually
conjoined. But here again, what grounds of fact are
there for admitting this recall? We are quite unconscious
of any such images of the past. And the conception of all
the forms of association as resultants of the elementary fact
of habit-worn paths in the brain makes such images entirely
superfluous for explaining the phenomena in point. Since
the brain-process of 'this,' the sign of A, has repeatedly
been aroused in company with the process of the full object
A, direct paths of irradiation from the one to the other must
be already established. And although roundabout paths
may also be possible, as from 'this' to 'those,' and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
from 'those' to 'A' (paths which would lead to practically
the same conclusion as the straighter ones), yet there is no
ground whatever for assuming them to be traversed now,
especially since appearances point the other way. In
<i>explicit</i> reasoning, such paths are doubtless traversed; in
perception they are in all probability closed. So far, then,
from perception being a species of reasoning properly so
called, both it and reasoning are co-ordinate varieties of that
deeper sort of process known psychologically as the association
of ideas, and physiologically as the law of habit in
the brain. <i>To call perception unconscious reasoning is thus
either a useless metaphor, or a positively misleading confusion
between two different things.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One more point and we may leave the subject of Perception.
<i>Sir Wm. Hamilton thought that he had discovered a
'great law'</i> which had been wholly overlooked by psychologists,
and which, 'simple and universal,' is this: "Knowledge
and Feeling,&mdash;Perception and Sensation, though always
coexistent, are always in the inverse ratio of each
other." Hamilton wrote as if perception and sensation
were two coexistent elements entering into a single state
of consciousness. Spencer refines upon him by contending
that they are two mutually exclusive <i>states</i> of consciousness,
not two elements of a single state. If sensation be
taken, as both Hamilton and Spencer mainly take it in this
discussion, to mean the feeling of <i>pleasure</i> or <i>pain</i>, there is
no doubt that the law, however expressed, is true; and that
the mind which is strongly conscious of the pleasantness or
painfulness of an experience is <i>ipso facto</i> less fitted to
observe and analyze its outward cause.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Apart from pleasure
and pain, however, the law seems but a corollary of the
fact that the more concentrated a state of consciousness is,
the more vivid it is. When feeling a color, or listening to
a tone <i>per se</i>, we get it more intensely, notice it better, than
when we are aware of it merely as one among many other
properties of a total object. The more diffused cerebral
excitement of the perceptive state is probably incompatible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
with quite as strong an excitement of separate parts as
the sensational state comports. So we come back here to
our own earlier discrimination between the perceptive and
the sensational processes, and to the examples which we
gave on <a href="#Page_80">pp. 80</a>, <a href="#Page_81">81</a>.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<h4>HALLUCINATIONS.</h4>


<p>Between normal perception and illusion we have seen
that there is no break, the <i>process</i> being identically the same
in both. The last illusions we considered might fairly be
called hallucinations. We must now consider the false
perceptions more commonly called by that name.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
ordinary parlance hallucination is held to differ from illusion in
that, whilst there is an object really there in illusion, <i>in hallucination
there is no objective stimulus at all</i>. We shall presently
see that this supposed absence of objective stimulus in hallucination
is a mistake, and that hallucinations are often
only <i>extremes</i> of the perception process, in which the secondary
cerebral reaction is out of all normal proportion to the
peripheral stimulus which occasions the activity. Hallucinations
usually appear abruptly and have the character of
being forced upon the subject. But they possess various
degrees of apparent <i>objectivity</i>. One mistake <i>in limine</i> must
be guarded against. They are often talked of as mental
<i>images</i> projected outwards by mistake. But where an hallucination
is complete, it is much more than a mental image.
<i>An hallucination is a strictly sensational form of consciousness,
as good and true a sensation as if there were a real object there.</i>
The object happens not to be there, that is all.</p>

<p>The milder degrees of hallucination have been designated
as <i>pseudo-hallucinations</i>. Pseudo-hallucinations and
hallucinations have been sharply distinguished from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
other only within a few years. Dr. Kandinsky writes of
their difference as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In carelessly questioning a patient we may confound his pseudo-hallucinatory
perceptions with hallucinations. But to the unconfused
consciousness of the patient himself, even though he be imbecile, the
identification of the two phenomena is impossible, at least in the sphere
of vision. At the moment of having a pseudo-hallucination of sight,
the patient feels himself in an entirely different relation to this subjective
sensible appearance, from that in which he finds himself whilst
subject to a true visual hallucination. The latter is reality itself; the
former, on the contrary, remains always a subjective phenomenon
which the individual commonly regards either as sent to him as a sign
of God's grace, or as artificially induced by his secret persecutors....
If he knows by his <i>own experience</i> what a genuine hallucination is, it is
quite impossible for him to mistake the pseudo-hallucination for it....
A concrete example will make the difference clear:</p>

<p>"Dr. N. L.... heard one day suddenly amongst the voices of his
persecutors ('coming from a hollow space in the midst of the wall') a
rather loud voice impressively saying to him: 'Change your national
allegiance.' Understanding this to mean that his only hope consisted
in ceasing to be subject to the Czar of Russia, he reflected a moment
what allegiance would be better, and resolved to become an English subject.
At the same moment he saw a pseudo-hallucinatory lion of
natural size, which appeared and quickly laid its fore-paws on his
shoulders. He had a lively feeling of these paws as a tolerably painful
local pressure (complete hallucination of touch). Then the same voice
from the wall said: 'Now you have a lion&mdash;now you will rule,' whereupon
the patient recollected that the lion was the national emblem of
England. The lion appeared to L. very distinct and vivid, but he nevertheless
remained conscious, as he afterwards expressed it, that he saw the
animal, not with his bodily but with his mental eyes. (After his recovery
he called analogous apparitions by the name of 'expressive-plastic
ideas.') Accordingly he felt no terror, even though he felt the contact of
the claws.... Had the lion been a complete hallucination, the patient,
as he himself remarked after recovery, would have felt great fear, and
very likely screamed or taken to flight. Had it been a simple image of
the fancy he would not have connected it with the voices, of whose objective
reality he was at the time quite convinced."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From ordinary images of memory and fancy, pseudo-hallucinations
differ in being much more vivid, minute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
detailed, steady, abrupt, and spontaneous, in the sense that
all feeling of our own activity in producing them is lacking.
Dr. Kandinsky had a patient who, after taking opium or
haschisch, had abundant pseudo-hallucinations and hallucinations.
As he also had strong visualizing power and
was an educated physician, the three sorts of phenomena
could be easily compared. Although projected outwards
(usually not farther than the limit of distinctest vision, a
foot or so) the pseudo-hallucinations <i>lacked the character of
objective reality</i> which the hallucinations possessed, but,
unlike the pictures of imagination, it was almost impossible
to produce them at will. Most of the 'voices' which people
hear (whether they give rise to delusions or not) are pseudo-hallucinations.
They are described as '<i>inner</i>' voices, although
their character is entirely unlike the inner speech
of the subject with himself. I know two persons who hear
such inner voices making unforeseen remarks whenever they
grow quiet and listen for them. They are a very common
incident of delusional insanity, and at last grow into vivid
hallucinations. The latter are comparatively frequent occurrences
in sporadic form; and certain individuals are
liable to have them often. From the results of the 'Census
of Hallucinations,' which was begun by Edmund Gurney, it
would appear that, roughly speaking, one person at least
in every ten is likely to have had a vivid hallucination at
some time in his life.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The following cases from healthy
people will give an idea of what these hallucinations are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When a girl of eighteen, I was one evening engaged in a very
painful discussion with an elderly person. My distress was so great
that I took up a thick ivory knitting-needle that was lying on the mantelpiece
of the parlor and broke it into small pieces as I talked. In the
midst of the discussion I was very wishful to know the opinion of a
brother with whom I had an unusually close relationship. I turned
round and saw him sitting at the further side of a centre-table, with his
arms folded (an unusual position with him), but, to my dismay, I perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
from the sarcastic expression of his mouth that he was not in
sympathy with me, was not 'taking my side,' as I should then have
expressed it. The surprise cooled me, and the discussion was dropped.</p>

<p>"Some minutes after, having occasion to speak to my brother, I
turned towards him, but he was gone. I inquired when he left the
room, and was told that he had not been in it, which I did not believe,
thinking that he had come in for a minute and had gone out without
being noticed. About an hour and a half afterwards he appeared, and
convinced me, with some trouble, that he had never been near the
house that evening. He is still alive and well."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is another case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One night in March 1873 or '74, I cannot recollect which year,
I was attending on the sick-bed of my mother. About eight o'clock in
the evening I went into the dining-room to fix a cup of tea, and on turning
from the sideboard to the table, on the other side of the table before
the fire, which was burning brightly, as was also the gas, I saw standing
with his hand clasped to his side in true military fashion a soldier of
about thirty years of age, with dark, piercing eyes looking directly into
mine. He wore a small cap with standing feather; his costume was
also of a soldierly style. He did not strike me as being a spirit, ghost,
or anything uncanny, only a living man; but after gazing for fully a
minute I realized that it was nothing of earth, for he neither moved
his eyes nor his body, and in looking closely I could see the fire beyond.
I was of course startled, and yet did not run out of the room. I felt
stunned. I walked out rapidly, however, and turning to the servant
in the hall asked her if she saw anything. She said not. I went into
my mother's room and remained talking for about an hour, but never
mentioned the above subject for fear of exciting her, and finally forgot
it altogether, returning to the dining-room, still in forgetfulness of
what had occurred, but repeating, as above, the turning from sideboard
to table in act of preparing more tea. I looked casually towards the
fire, and there I saw the soldier again. This time I was entirely alarmed,
and fled from the room in haste. I called to my father, but when he
came he saw nothing."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes more than one sense is affected. The following
is a case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In response to your request to write out my experience of Oct. 30,
1886, I will inflict on you a letter.</p>

<p>"On the day above mentioned, Oct. 30, 1886, I was in &mdash;&mdash;,
where I was teaching. I had performed my regular routine work for
the day, and was sitting in my room working out trigonometrical formulæ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
I was expecting every day to hear of the confinement of my wife,
and naturally my thoughts for some time had been more or less with
her. She was, by the way, in B&mdash;&mdash;, some fifty miles from me.</p>

<p>"At the time, however, neither she nor the expected event was in my
mind; as I said, I was working out trigonometrical formulæ, and I had
been working on trigonometry the entire evening. About eleven
o'clock, as I sat there buried in sines, cosines, tangents, cotangents,
secants, and cosecants, I felt very distinctly upon my left shoulder a
touch, and a slight shake, as if somebody had tried to attract my attention
by other means and had failed. Without rising I turned my
head, and there between me and the door stood my wife, dressed exactly
as I last saw her, some five weeks before. As I turned she said: 'It
is a little Herman; he has come.' Something more was said, but this
is the only sentence I can recall. To make sure that I was not asleep
and dreaming, I rose from the chair, pinched myself and walked toward
the figure, which disappeared immediately as I rose. I can give no information
as to the length of time occupied by this episode, but I know
I was awake, in my usual good health. The touch was very distinct,
the figure was absolutely perfect, stood about three feet from the door,
which was closed, and had not been opened during the evening. The
sound of the voice was unmistakable, and I should have recognized it as
my wife's voice even if I had not turned and had not seen the figure
at all. The tone was conversational, just as if she would have said
the same words had she been actually standing there.</p>

<p>"In regard to myself, I would say, as I have already intimated, I was
in my usual good health; I had not been sick before, nor was I after
the occurrence, not so much as a headache having afflicted me.</p>

<p>"Shortly after the experience above described, I retired for the night
and, as I usually do, slept quietly until morning. I did not speculate
particularly about the strange appearance of the night before, and
though I thought of it some, I did not tell anybody. The following
morning I rose, not conscious of having dreamed anything, but I was
very firmly impressed with the idea that there was something for me at
the telegraph-office. I tried to throw off the impression, for so far as I
knew there was no reason for it. Having nothing to do, I went out for
a walk; and to help throw off the impression above noted, I walked
away from the telegraph-office. As I proceeded, however, the impression
became a conviction, and I actually turned about and went to the
very place I had resolved not to visit, the telegraph-office. The first
person I saw on arriving at said office was the telegraph-operator, who
being on terms of intimacy with me, remarked: 'Hello, papa, I've got
a telegram for you.' The telegram announced the birth of a boy,
weighing nine pounds, and that all were doing well. Now, then, I have
no theory at all about the events narrated above; I never had any such
experience before nor since; I am no believer in spiritualism, am not in
the least superstitious, know very little about 'thought-transference,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
'unconscious cerebration,' etc., etc., but I am absolutely certain about
what I have tried to relate.</p>

<p>"In regard to the remark which I heard, 'It is a little Herman,' etc.;
I would add that we had previously decided to call the child, if a boy,

<p>The hallucination sometimes carries a change of the
general consciousness with it, so as to appear more like a
sudden lapse into a dream. The following case was given
me by a man of 43, who had never anything resembling it
before:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While sitting at my desk this <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> reading a circular of the Loyal
Legion a very curious thing happened to me, such as I have never experienced.
It was perfectly real, so real that it took some minutes to
recover from. It seems to me like a direct intromission into some other
world. I never had anything approaching it before save when dreaming
at night. I was wide awake, of course. But this was the feeling. I
had only just sat down and become interested in the circular, when I
seemed to lose myself for a minute and then found myself in the top
story of a high building very white and shining and clean, with a
noble window immediately at the right of where I sat. Through this
window I looked out upon a marvellous reach of landscape entirely new.
I never had before such a sense of infinity in nature, such superb
stretches of light and color and <i>cleanness</i>. I know that for the space
of three minutes I was entirely lost, for when I began to come to, so to
speak,&mdash;sitting in that other world, I debated for three or four minutes
more as to which was dream and which was reality. Sitting there I got
a faint sense of C.... [the town in which the writer was], away off
and dim at first. Then I remember thinking 'Why, I used to live in
C....; perhaps I am going back.' Slowly C.... did come back, and
I found myself at my desk again. For a few minutes the process of
determining where I was was very funny. But the whole experience
was perfectly delightful, there was such a sense of brilliancy and
clearness and lightness about it. I suppose it lasted in all about seven
minutes or ten minutes."</p></blockquote>

<p>The hallucinations of fever-delirium are a mixture of
pseudo-hallucination, true hallucination, and illusion.
Those of opium, hasheesh, and belladonna resemble them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in this respect. The following vivid account of a fit of
hasheesh-delirium has been given me by a friend:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was reading a newspaper, and the indication of the approaching
delirium was an inability to keep my mind fixed on the narrative. Directly
I lay down upon a sofa there appeared before my eyes several
rows of human hands, which oscillated for a moment, revolved and then
changed to spoons. The same motions were repeated, the objects changing
to wheels, tin soldiers, lamp-posts, brooms, and countless other
absurdities. This stage lasted about ten minutes, and during that
time it is safe to say that I saw at least a thousand different objects.
These whirling images did not appear like the realities of life, but had
the character of the secondary images seen in the eye after looking at
some brightly-illuminated object. A mere suggestion from the person
who was with me in the room was sufficient to call up an image of the
thing suggested, while without suggestion there appeared all the common
objects of life and many unreal monstrosities, which it is absolutely
impossible to describe, and which seemed to be creations of the
brain.</p>

<p>"The character of the symptoms changed rapidly. A sort of wave
seemed to pass over me, and I became aware of the fact that my pulse
was beating rapidly. I took out my watch, and by exercising considerable
will-power managed to time the heart-beats, 135 to the minute.</p>

<p>"I could feel each pulsation through my whole system, and a curious
twitching commenced, which no effort of the mind could stop.</p>

<p>"There were moments of apparent lucidity, when it seemed as if I
could see within myself, and watch the pumping of my heart. A
strange fear came over me, a certainty that I should never recover from
the effects of the opiate, which was as quickly followed by a feeling of
great interest in the experiment, a certainty that the experience was
the most novel and exciting that I had ever been through.</p>

<p>"My mind was in an exceedingly impressionable state. Any place
thought of or suggested appeared with all the distinctness of the reality.
I thought of the Giant's Causeway in Staffa, and instantly I stood
within the portals of Fingal's Cave. Great basaltic columns rose on all
sides, while huge waves rolled through the chasm and broke in silence
upon the rocky shore. Suddenly there was a roar and blast of sound,
and the word 'Ishmaral' was echoing up the cave. At the enunciation
of this remarkable word the great columns of basalt changed into whirling
clothes pins and I laughed aloud at the absurdity.</p>

<p>"(I may here state that the word 'Ishmaral' seemed to haunt my
other hallucinations, for I remember that I heard it frequently thereafter.)
I next enjoyed a sort of metempsychosis. Any animal or
thing that I thought of could be made the being which held my mind.
I thought of a fox, and instantly I was transformed into that animal. I
could distinctly feel myself a fox, could see my long ears and bushy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
tail, and by a sort of introvision felt that my complete anatomy was
that of a fox. Suddenly the point of vision changed. My eyes seemed
to be located at the back of my mouth; I looked out between the parted
lips, saw the two rows of pointed teeth, and, closing my mouth with a
snap, saw&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>"I was next transformed into a bombshell, felt my size, weight, and
thickness, and experienced the sensation of being shot up out of a giant
mortar, looking down upon the earth, bursting and falling back in a
shower of iron fragments.</p>

<p>"Into countless other objects was I transformed, many of them so
absurd that I am unable to conceive what suggested them. For example,
I was a little china doll, deep down in a bottle of olive oil, next
moment a stick of twisted candy, then a skeleton inclosed in a whirling
coffin, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>"Towards the end of the delirium the whirling images appeared
again, and I was haunted by a singular creation of the brain, which reappeared
every few moments. It was an image of a double-faced doll,
with a cylindrical body running down to a point like a peg-top.</p>

<p>"It was always the same, having a sort of crown on its head, and
painted in two colors, green and brown, on a background of blue. The
expression of the Janus-like profiles was always the same, as were the
adornments of the body. After recovering from the effects of the
drug I could not picture to myself exactly how this singular monstrosity
appeared, but in subsequent experiences I was always visited by
this phantom, and always recognized every detail of its composition.
It was like visiting some long-forgotten spot and seeing some sight that
had faded from the memory, but which appeared perfectly familiar as
soon as looked upon.</p>

<p>"The effects of the drug lasted about an hour and a half, leaving
me a trifle tipsy and dizzy; but after a ten-hour sleep I was myself
again, save for a slight inability to keep my mind fixed on any piece of
work for any length of time, which remained with me during most of
the next day."</p></blockquote>


<h4>THE NEURAL PROCESS IN HALLUCINATION.</h4>


<p>Examples of these singular perversions of perception
might be multiplied indefinitely, but I have no more space.
Let us turn to the question of what the physiological process
may be to which they are due. It must, of course,
consist of an excitement from within of those centres which
are active in normal perception, identical in kind and degree
with that which real external objects are usually
needed to induce. The particular process which currents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
from the sense-organs arouse would seem under
normal circumstances to be arousable in no other way. On
<a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a> ff. above, we saw that the centres aroused by incoming
peripheral currents are probably identical with the
centres used in mere imagination; and that the vividness
of the sensational kind of consciousness is probably correlated
with a discrete degree of <i>intensity</i> in the process
therein aroused. Referring the reader back to that passage
and to what was more lately said on <a href="#Page_103">p. 103</a> ff., I now
proceed to complete my theory of the perceptive process
by an analysis of what may most probably be believed to
take place in hallucination strictly so called.</p>

<p>We have seen (<a href="#Page_75">p. 75</a>) that the free discharge of cells
into each other through associative paths is a likely reason
why the maximum intensity of function is not reached
when the cells are excited by their neighbors in the cortex.
At the end of <a href="#CHAPTER_XXV395">Chapter XXV</a> we shall return to this conception,
and whilst making it still more precise, use it for explaining
certain phenomena connected with the will. The
idea is that the leakage forward along these paths is too
rapid for the inner tension in any centre to accumulate to
the maximal explosion-point, unless the exciting currents
are greater than those which the various portions of the
cortex supply to each other. Currents from the periphery
are (as it seems) the only currents whose energy can vanquish
the supra-ideational resistance (so to call it) of the
cells, and cause the peculiarly intense sort of disintegration
with which the sensational quality is linked. <i>If, however,
the leakage forward were to stop,</i> the tension inside certain
cells might reach the explosion-point, even though the
influence which excited them came only from neighboring
cortical parts. Let an empty pail with a leak in its bottom,
tipped up against a support so that if it ever became full
of water it would upset, represent the resting condition of
the centre for a certain sort of feeling. Let water poured
into it stand for the currents which are its natural stimulus;
then the hole in its bottom will, of course, represent the
'paths' by which it transmits its excitement to other associated
cells. Now let two other vessels have the function<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
of supplying it with water. One of these vessels stands
for the neighboring cortical cells, and can pour in hardly
any more water than goes out by the leak. The pail consequently
never upsets in consequence of the supply from
this source. A current of water passes through it and does
work elsewhere, but in the pail itself nothing but what
stands for <i>ideational</i> activity is aroused. The other vessel,
however, stands for the peripheral sense-organs, and supplies
a stream of water so copious that the pail promptly
fills up in spite of the leak, and presently <i>upsets</i>; in other
words, <i>sensational</i> activity is aroused. But it is obvious that
if the leak were plugged, the slower stream of supply
would also end by upsetting the pail.</p>

<p>To apply this to the brain and to thought, if we take a
series of processes A B C D E, associated together in that
order, and suppose that the current through them is very
fluent, there will be little intensity anywhere until, perhaps,
a pause occurs at E. But the moment the current is blocked
anywhere, say between C and D, the process in C must
grow more intense, and might even be conceived to explode
so as to produce a sensation in the mind instead of an idea.</p>

<p>It would seem that some hallucinations are best to be
explained in this way. We have in fact a regular series of
facts which can all be formulated under the single law that <i>the
substantive strength of a state of consciousness bears an inverse
proportion to its suggestiveness</i>. It is the halting-places of
our thought which are occupied with distinct imagery.
Most of the words we utter have no time to awaken images
at all; they simply awaken the following words. But when
the sentence <i>stops</i>, an image dwells for awhile before the
mental eye (see Vol. I. p. 243). Again, whenever the associative
processes are reduced and impeded by the approach
of unconsciousness, as in falling asleep, or growing faint, or
becoming narcotized, we find a concomitant increase in the
intensity of whatever partial consciousness may survive. In
some people what M. Maury has called 'hypnagogic' hallucinations<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
are the regular concomitant of the process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
falling asleep. Trains of faces, landscapes, etc., pass before
the mental eye, first as fancies, then as pseudo-hallucinations,
finally as full-fledged hallucinations forming dreams.
If we regard association-paths as paths of drainage, then the
shutting off of one after another of them as the encroaching
cerebral paralysis advances ought to act like the plugging
of the hole in the bottom of the pail, and make the activity
more intense in those systems of cells that retain any
activity at all. The level rises because the currents are
not drained away, until at last the full sensational explosion
may occur.</p>

<p>The usual explanation of hypnagogic hallucinations is
that they are ideas deprived of their ordinary <i>reductives</i>. In
somnolescence, sensations being extinct, the mind, it is said,
then having no stronger things to compare its ideas with,
ascribes to these the fulness of reality. At ordinary times
the objects of our imagination are reduced to the <i>status</i> of
subjective facts by the ever-present contrast of our sensations
with them. Eliminate the sensations, however, this
view supposes, and the 'images' are forthwith 'projected'
into the outer world and appear as realities. Thus is the
illusion of dreams also explained. This, indeed, after a
fashion gives an account of the facts.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> And yet it certainly
fails to explain the extraordinary vivacity and completeness
of so many of our dream-fantasms. The process of 'imagining'
must (in these cases at least<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>) be not merely relatively,
but absolutely and in itself more intense than at other
times. The fact is, it is not a process of imagining, but a
genuine sensational process; and the theory in question is
therefore false as far as that point is concerned.</p>

<p>Dr. Hughlings Jackson's explanation of the epileptic
seizure is acknowledged to be masterly. It involves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
principles exactly like those which I am bringing forward
here. The 'loss of consciousness' in epilepsy is due to the
most highly organized brain-processes being exhausted
and thrown out of gear. The less organized (more instinctive)
processes, ordinarily inhibited by the others, are then
exalted, so that we get as a mere consequence of relief from
the inhibition, the meaningless or maniacal action which
so often follows the attack.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Similarly the <i>subsultus tendinorum</i> or jerking of the
muscles which so often startles us when we are on the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of falling asleep, may be interpreted as due to the rise (in
certain lower motor centres) of the ordinary 'tonic' tension
to the explosion-point, when the inhibition commonly exerted
by the higher centres falls too suddenly away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One possible condition of hallucination then stands
revealed, whatever other conditions there may be. <i>When
the normal paths of association between a centre and other centres
are thrown out of gear, any activity which may exist in the
first centre tends to increase in intensity until finally the point
may be reached at which the last inward resistance is overcome,
and the full sensational process explodes.</i><a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Thus it will happen
that causes of an amount of activity in brain-cells which
would ordinarily result in a weak consciousness may produce
a very strong consciousness when the overflow of these
cells is stopped by the torpor of the rest of the brain. A
slight peripheral irritation, then, if it reaches the centres of
consciousness at all during sleep, will give rise to the dream
of a violent sensation. All the books about dreaming are
full of anecdotes which illustrate this. For example, M.
Maury's nose and lips are tickled with a feather while he
sleeps. He dreams he is being tortured by having a pitch-plaster
applied to his face, torn off, lacerating the skin of
nose and lips. Descartes, on being bitten by a flea, dreams
of being run through by a sword. A friend tells me, as I
write this, of his hair changing its position in his forehead
just as he 'dozed off' in his chair a few days since. Instantly
he dreamed that some one had struck him a blow.
Examples can be quoted <i>ad libitum</i>, but these are enough.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>We seem herewith to have an explanation for a certain
number of hallucinations. <i>Whenever the normal forward
irradiation of intra-cortical excitement through association-paths
is checked, any accidental spontaneous activity or any peripheral
stimulation (however inadequate at other times) by which a brain-centre
may be visited, sets up a process of full sensational intensity
therein.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the hallucinations artificially produced in hypnotic
subjects, some degree of peripheral excitement seems usually
to be required. The brain is asleep as far as its own
spontaneous thinking goes, and the words of the 'magnetizer'
then awaken a cortical process which drafts off into
itself any currents of a related sort which may come in
from the periphery, resulting in a vivid objective perception
of the suggested thing. Thus, point to a dot on a
sheet of paper, and call it 'General Grant's photograph,'
and your subject will see a photograph of the General
there instead of the dot. The dot gives objectivity to the
appearance, and the suggested notion of the General gives
it form. Then magnify the dot by a lens; double it by a
prism or by nudging the eyeball; reflect it in a mirror;
turn it upside down; or wipe it out; and the subject will
tell you that the 'photograph' has been enlarged, doubled,
reflected, turned about, or made to disappear. In M. Binet's
language,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> the dot is the outward <i>point de repère</i> which is
needed to give objectivity to your suggestion, and without
which the latter will only produce a <i>conception</i> in the
subject's mind.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> M. Binet has shown that such a peripheral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
<i>point de repère</i> is used in an enormous number, not only
of hypnotic hallucinations, but of hallucinations of the
insane. These latter are often <i>unilateral</i>; that is, the patient
hears the voices always on one side of him, or sees the
figure only when a certain one of his eyes is open. In
many of these cases it has been distinctly proved that a
morbid irritation in the internal ear, or an opacity in the
humors of the eye, was the starting point of the current
which the patient's diseased acoustic or optical centres
clothed with their peculiar products in the way of ideas.
<i>Hallucinations produced in this way are</i> <span class="smcap">'illusions'</span> <i>and M.
Binet's theory, that all hallucinations must start in the periphery,
may be called an attempt to reduce hallucination and illusion to
one physiological type,</i> the type, namely, to which normal perception
belongs. In every case, according to M. Binet,
whether of perception, of hallucination, or of illusion, we
get the sensational vividness by means of a current from
the peripheral nerves. It may be a mere trace of a current.
But that trace is enough to kindle the maximal or
supra-ideational process so that the object perceived will
have the character of <i>externality</i>. What the <i>nature</i> of the
object shall be will depend wholly on the particular system
of paths in which the process is kindled. Part of the
thing in all cases comes from the sense-organ, the rest is
furnished by the mind. But we cannot by introspection
distinguish between these parts; and our only formula for
the result is that the brain has <i>reacted on</i> the impression in
the normal way. Just so in the dreams which we have
considered, and in the hallucinations of which M. Binet
tells, we can only say that the brain has <i>reacted</i> in an abnormal
way.</p>

<p><i>M. Binet's theory accounts indeed for a multitude of cases,
but certainly not for all.</i> The prism does not always double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the false appearance,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> nor does the latter always disappear
when the eyes are closed. Dr. Hack Tuke<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> gives several
examples in sane people of well-exteriorized hallucinations
which did not respond to Binet's tests; and Mr. Edmund
Gurney<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> gives a number of reasons why intensity in a cortical
process may be expected to result from local pathological
activity just as much as its peculiar nature does.
For Binet, an abnormally or exclusively active part of the
cortex gives the <i>nature</i> of what shall appear, whilst a peripheral
sense-organ alone can give the <i>intensity</i> sufficient to
make it appear projected into real space. But since this
intensity is after all but a matter of degree, one does not see
why, under rare conditions, the degree in question <i>might</i>
not be attained by inner causes exclusively. In that case
we should have certain hallucinations centrally initiated
alongside of the peripherally initiated hallucinations, which
are the only sort that M. Binet's theory allows. <i>It seems
probable on the whole, therefore, that centrally initiated hallucinations
can exist.</i> How often they do exist is another question.
The existence of hallucinations which affect more
than one sense is an argument for central initiation. For
grant that the thing seen may have its starting point in the
outer world, the voice which it is heard to utter must be
due to an influence from the visual region, i.e. must be of
central origin.</p>

<p>Sporadic cases of hallucination, visiting people only
once in a lifetime (which seem to be by far the most frequent
type), are on any theory hard to understand in detail.
They are often extraordinarily complete; and the fact that
many of them are reported as <i>veridical</i>, that is, as coinciding
with real events, such as accidents, deaths, etc., of the
persons seen, is an additional complication of the phenomenon.
The first really scientific study of hallucination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
in all its possible bearings, on the basis of a large mass of
empirical material, was begun by Mr. Edmund Gurney and
is continued by other members of the Society for Psychical
Research; and the 'Census' is now being applied
to several countries under the auspices of the International
Congress of Experimental Psychology. It is to be hoped
that out of these combined labors something solid will
eventually grow. The facts shade off into the phenomena
of motor automatism, trance, etc.; and nothing but a wide
comparative study can give really instructive results.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><i>The part played by the peripheral sense-organ</i> in hallucination
is just as obscure as we found it in the case of imagination.
The things seen often seem opaque and hide the
background upon which they are projected. It does not
follow from this, however, that the retina is actually involved
in the vision. A contrary process going on in the
visual centres would prevent the retinal impression made
by the outer realities from being felt, and this would in
mental terms be equivalent to the hiding of them by the
imaginary figure. The negative after-images of mental
pictures reported by Meyer and Féré, and the negative after-images
of hypnotic hallucinations reported by Binet and
others so far constitute the only evidence there is for the
retina being involved. But until these after-images are
explained in some other way we must admit the possibility
of a centrifugal current from the optical centres downwards
into the peripheral organ of sight, paradoxical as the course
of such a current may appear.</p>

<h4>'PERCEPTION-TIME.'</h4>

<p><i>The time which the perceptive process occupies</i> has been
inquired into by various experimenters. Some call it perception-time,
some choice-time, some discrimination-time.
The results have been already given in Chapter XIII (vol.
I, p. 523 ff.), to which the reader is consequently referred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Romanes gives an interesting variation of these
time-measurements. He found<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"an astonishing difference between different individuals with respect
to the rate at which they are able to <i>read</i>. Of course reading implies
enormously intricate processes of perception both of the sensuous and
of the intellectual order; but if we choose for these observations persons
who have been accustomed to read much, we may consider that
they are all very much on a par with respect to the amount of practice
which they have had, so that the differences in their rates of reading
may fairly be attributed to real differences in their rates of forming
complex perceptions in rapid succession, and not to any merely accidental
differences arising from greater or less facility acquired by
special practice.</p>

<p>"My experiments consisted in marking a brief printed paragraph in
a book which had never been read by any of the persons to whom it
was to be presented. The paragraph, which contained simple statements
of simple facts, was marked on the margin with pencil. The
book was then placed before the reader open, the page, however, being
covered with a sheet of paper. Having pointed out to the reader upon
this sheet of paper what part of the underlying page the marked paragraph
occupied, I suddenly removed the sheet of paper with one hand,
while I started a chronograph with the other. Twenty seconds being
allowed for reading the paragraph (ten lines octavo), as soon as the
time was up I again suddenly placed the sheet of paper over the printed
page, passed the book on to the next reader, and repeated the experiment
as before. Meanwhile, the first reader, the moment after the
book had been removed, wrote down all that he or she could remember
having read. And so on with all the other readers.</p>

<p>"Now the results of a number of experiments conducted on this
method were to show, as I have said, astonishing differences in the
<i>maximum</i> rate of reading which is possible to different individuals, all
of whom have been accustomed to extensive reading. That is to say,
the difference may amount to 4 to 1; or, otherwise stated, in a given
time one individual may be able to read four times as much as another.
Moreover, it appeared that there was no relationship between slowness
of reading and power of assimilation; on the contrary, when all the
efforts are directed to assimilating as much as possible in a given time,
the rapid readers (as shown by their written notes) usually give a better
account of the portions of the paragraph which have been compassed
by the slow readers than the latter are able to give; and the
most rapid reader I have found is also the best at assimilating. I
should further say that there is no relationship between rapidity of
perception as thus tested and intellectual activity as tested by the general

notices, see Hamilton's Lectures on Metaphysics, ii. 96. For Hamilton
perception is 'the consciousness of external objects' (<i>ib.</i> 28). Spencer
defines it oddly enough as "a discerning of the relation or relations between
<i>states of consciousness</i> partly presentative and partly representative;
which states of consciousness must be themselves known to the extent involved
in the knowledge of their relations" (Psychol., § 355).</p></div>

by pressure on the eyeballs, congestion of the head, inhalation of
anæsthetics, etc., might again be cited to prove that faint and vague excitements
of sense-organs are transformed into figured objects by the brain,
only the facts are not quite clearly interpretable; and the figuring may
possibly be due to some retinal peculiarity, as yet unexplored. Beautiful
patterns, which would do for wall-papers, succeed each other when the
eyeballs are long pressed. Goethe's account of his own phantasm of a
flower is well known. It came in the middle of his visual field whenever
he closed his eyes and depressed his head, "unfolding itself and developing
from its interior new flowers, formed of colored or sometimes green
leaves, not natural but of fantastic forms, and symmetrical as the rosettes
of sculptors," etc. (quoted in Müller's Physiology, Baly's tr., p. 1397). The
fortification- and zigzag-patterns, which are well-known appearances in the
field of view in certain functional disorders, have characteristics (steadiness,
coerciveness, blotting out of other objects) suggestive of a retinal origin&mdash;this
is why the entire class of phenomena treated of in this note seem to me
still doubtfully connected with the cerebral factor in perception of which
the text treats.&mdash;I copy from Taine's book on Intelligence (vol. i. p. 61)
the translation of an interesting observation by Prof. M. Lazarus, in which
the same effect of an after-image is seen. Lazarus himself proposes the
name of 'visionary illusions' for such modifications of ideal pictures by
peripheral stimulations (Lehre von den Sinnestäuschungen, 1867, p. 19).
"I was on the Kaltbad terrace at Rigi, on a very clear afternoon, and
attempting to make out the Waldbruder, a rock which stands out from
the midst of the gigantic wall of mountains surrounding it, on whose summits
we see like a crown the glaciers of Titlis, Uri-Rothsdock, etc. I was
looking alternately with the naked eye and with a spy-glass; but could not
distinguish it with the naked eye. For the space of six to ten minutes I
had gazed steadfastly upon the mountains, whose color varied according
to their several altitudes or declivities between violet, brown, and dark
green, and I had fatigued myself to no purpose, when I ceased looking
and turned away. At that moment I saw before me (I cannot recollect
whether my eyes were shut or open) the figure of an absent friend, like a
corpse.... I asked myself at once how I had come to think of my absent
friend.&mdash;In a few seconds I regained the thread of my thoughts, which
my looking for the Waldbruder had interrupted, and readily found that the
idea of my friend had by a very simple necessity introduced itself among
them. My recollecting him was thus naturally accounted for.&mdash;But in
addition to this, he had appeared as a corpse. How was this?&mdash;At this
moment, whether through fatigue or in order to think, I closed my eyes,
and found at once the whole field of sight, over a considerable extent,
covered with the same corpse-like hue, a greenish-yellow gray. I thought
at once that I had here the principle of the desired explanation, and
attempted to recall to memory the forms of other persons. And, in fact,
these forms too appeared like corpses; standing or sitting, as I wished, all
had a corpse-like tint. The persons whom I wished to see did not all appear
to me as sensible phantoms; and again, when my eyes were open. I
did not see phantoms, or at all events only saw them faintly, of no determined
color.&mdash;I then inquired how it was that phantoms of persons were
affected by and colored like the visual field surrounding them, how their
outlines were traced, and if their faces and clothes were of the same color.
But it was then too late, or perhaps the influence of reflection and examination
had been too powerful. All grew suddenly pale, and the subjective
phenomenon, which might have lasted some minutes longer, had disappeared.&mdash;It
is plain that here an inward reminiscence, arising in accordance
with the laws of association, had combined with an optical after-image.
The excessive excitation of the periphery of the optic nerve, I mean the
long-continued preceding sensation of my eyes when contemplating the
color of the mountain, had indirectly provoked a subjective and durable
sensation, that of the complementary color; and my reminiscence, incorporating
itself with this subjective sensation, became the corpse-like phantom
I have described."</p></div>

fallaciously perceived object and the experiences which correct it are both
tactile in these cases.</p></div>

being normally in contact, mean to us the same space, and hence it might
be supposed that when simultaneously touched, as by a pair of callipers,
we should feel but one object, whilst us a matter of fact we feel two. It
should be remarked in explanation of this that an object placed between
the two fingers in their normal uncrossed position always awakens the sense
of <i>two contacts</i>. When the fingers are <i>pressed together</i> we feel <i>one object</i> to
be between them. And when the fingers are crossed, and their corresponding
points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> simultaneously <i>pressed</i>, we do get something like the
illusion of singleness&mdash;that is, we get a very doubtful doubleness.</p></div>

do with the vacillating judgment in these atropin cases. The internal recti
contract whenever we accommodate. They squint and produce double
vision when the innervation for accommodation is excessive. To see
singly, when straining the atropinized accommodation, the contraction of
our internal <i>recti</i> must be neutralized by a correspondingly excessive contraction
of the external <i>recti</i>. But this is a sign of the object's recession, etc.</p></div>

is unintelligible under these conditions. If we do not get a very good seat
at a foreign theatre, we fail to follow the dialogue; and what gives trouble
to most of us when abroad is not only that the natives speak so fast, but
that they speak so indistinctly and so low. The verbal objects for interpreting
the sounds by are not alert and ready made in our minds, as they
are in our familiar mother-tongue, and do not start up at so faint a cue.</p></div>

Out of 140 persons whom I found to feel their lost foot, some did so
<i>dubiously</i>. "Either they only feel it occasionally, or only when it pains
them, or only when they try to move it; or they only feel it when they
'think a good deal about it' and make an effort to conjure it up. When
they 'grow inattentive,' the feeling 'flies back' or 'jumps back,' to the
stump. Every degree of consciousness, from complete and permanent hallucination
down to something hardly distinguishable from ordinary fancy,
seems represented in the sense of the missing extremity which these
patients say they have. Indeed I have seldom seen a more plausible lot of
evidence for the view that imagination and sensation are but differences of
vividness in an identical process than these confessions, taking them altogether,
contain. Many patients say they can hardly tell whether they
feel or fancy the limb."</p></div>

on to a pre-existing curiosity&mdash;i.e., to assimilate its matter in some
way to what is already known. Hence the advantage of "comparing all
that is far off and foreign to something that is near home, of making the
unknown plain by the example of the known, and of connecting all the
instruction with the personal experience of the pupil.... If the teacher is
to explain the distance of the sun from the earth, let him ask.... 'If anyone
there in the sun fired off a cannon straight at you, what should you
do?' 'Get out of the way' would be the answer. 'No need of that,'
the teacher might reply. 'You may quietly go to sleep in your room,
and get up again, you may wait till your confirmation-day, you may learn
a trade, and grow as old as I am,&mdash;<i>then</i> only will the cannon-ball be getting
near, <i>then</i> you may jump to one side! See, so great as that is the sun's

"The sight of a man walking is a familiar spectacle to us. We perceive
it as a connected whole, and at most notice the most striking of its peculiarities.
Strong attention is required, and a special choice of the point of
view, in order to feel the perpendicular and lateral oscillations of such a
walking figure. We must choose fitting points or lines in the background
with which to compare the positions of its head, but if a distant walking
man be looked at through an astronomical telescope (which inverts the
object), what a singular hopping and rocking appearance he presents! No
difficulty now in seeing the body's oscillations, and many other details of
the gait.... But, on the other hand, its total character, whether light or
clumsy, dignified or graceful, is harder to perceive than in the upright position."</p></div>

A delusion is a false opinion about a matter of fact, which need not necessarily
involve, though it often does involve, false perceptions of sensible
things. We may, for example, have religious delusions, medical delusions,
delusions about our own importance, about other peoples' characters, etc.,
<i>ad libitum</i>. The delusions of the insane are apt to affect certain typical
forms, often very hard to explain. But in many cases they are certainly
theories which the patients invent to account for their abnormal bodily
sensations. In other cases they are due to hallucinations of hearing and of
sight. Dr. Clouston (Clinical Lectures on Mental Disease, lecture iii <i>ad
fin.</i>) gives the following special delusions as having been found in about
a hundred melancholy female patients who were afflicted in this way.

<p>
The loss of vivacity in the images in the process of waking, as well as
the gain of it in falling asleep, are both well described by M. Taine, who
writes (on Intelligence, i. 50, 58) that often in the daytime, when fatigued
and seated in a chair, it is sufficient for him to close one eye with a handkerchief,
when, "by degrees, the sight of the other eye becomes vague,
and it closes. All external sensations are gradually effaced, or cease, at all
events, to be remarked; the internal images, on the other hand, feeble and
rapid during the state of complete wakefulness, become intense, distinct,
colored, steady, and lasting: there is a sort of ecstasy, accompanied by a
feeling of expansion and of comfort. Warned by frequent experience, I
know that sleep is coming on, and that I must not disturb the rising
vision; I remain passive, and in a few minutes it is complete. Architecture,
landscapes, moving figures, pass slowly by, and sometimes remain, with
incomparable clearness of form and fulness of being; sleep comes on, and
I know no more of the real world I am in. Many times, like M. Maury,
I have caused myself to be gently roused at different moments of this state,
and have thus been able to mark its characters.&mdash;The intense image which
seems an external object is but a more forcible continuation of the feeble
image which an instant before I recognized as internal; some scrap of a
forest, some house, some person which I vaguely imagined on closing my
eyes, has in a minute become present to me with full bodily details, so as to
change into a complete hallucination. Then, waking up on a hand touching
me, I feel the figure decay, lose color, and evaporate: what had appeared
a substance is reduced to a shadow.... In such a case, I have often
seen, for a passing moment, the image <i>grow pale</i>, waste away, and evaporate;
sometimes, on opening the eyes, a fragment of landscape or the skirt
of a dress appears still to float over the fire-irons or on the black hearth."
This persistence of dream-objects for a few moments after the eyes are
opened seems to be no extremely rare experience. Many cases of it have
been reported to me directly. Compare Müller's Physiology, Baly's tr.,
p. 945.</p></div>

with <i>some</i> paths of association being left. Some hypnotic patients will
not only have hallucinations of objects suggested to them, but will amplify
them and act out the situation. But the paths here seem excessively narrow,
and the reflections which ought to make the hallucination incredible
do not occur to the subject's mind. In general, the narrower a train of
'ideas' is, the vivider the consciousness is of each. Under ordinary circumstances,
the entire brain probably plays a part in draining any centre
which may be ideationally active. When the drainage is reduced in any
way it probably makes the active process more intense.</p></div>

is that in Mr. James Sully's book on 'Illusions' in the International
Scientific Series. On hallucinations the literature is large. Gurney,
Kandinsky (as already cited), and some articles by Kraepelin in the
Vierteljahrschrift für Wissenschaftliche Philosophie, vol. v (1881), are
the most systematic studies recently made. All works on Insanity treat
of them. Dr. W. W. Ireland's works, 'The Blot upon the Brain' (1886) and
'Through the Ivory Gate' (1890) have much information on the subject.
Gurney gives pretty complete references to older literature. The most
important thing on the subject from the point of view of theory is the
article by Mr. Myers on the Demon of Socrates in the Proceedings of the
Society for Psychical Research for 1889, p. 522.</p></div>

<h4>THE PERCEPTION OF SPACE.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></h4>

<h4>THE FEELING OF CRUDE EXTENSITY.</h4>


<p><i>In the sensations of hearing, touch, sight, and pain we are
accustomed to distinguish from among the other elements the
element of voluminousness.</i> We call the reverberations of a
thunderstorm more voluminous than the squeaking of a
slate-pencil; the entrance into a warm bath gives our skin
a more massive feeling than the prick of a pin; a little
neuralgic pain, fine as a cobweb, in the face, seems less extensive
than the heavy soreness of a boil or the vast discomfort
of a colic or a lumbago; and a solitary star looks smaller
than the noonday sky. In the sensation of dizziness or
subjective motion, which recent investigation has proved
to be connected with stimulation of the semi-circular canals
of the ear, the spatial character is very prominent. Whether
the 'muscular sense' directly yields us knowledge of space
is still a matter of litigation among psychologists. Whilst
some go so far as to ascribe our entire cognition of extension
to its exclusive aid, others deny to it all extensive
quality whatever. Under these circumstances we shall do
better to adjourn its consideration; admitting, however, that
it seems at first sight as if we felt something decidedly
more voluminous when we contract our thigh-muscles than
when we twitch an eyelid or some small muscle in the face.
It seems, moreover, as if this difference lay in the feeling
of the thigh-muscles themselves.</p>

<p>In the sensations of smell and taste this element of
varying vastness seems less prominent but not altogether
absent. Some tastes and smells appear less extensive than
complex flavors, like that of roast meat or plum pudding,
on the one hand, or heavy odors like musk or tuberose, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the other. The epithet <i>sharp</i> given to the acid class would
seem to show that to the popular mind there is something
narrow and, as it were, streaky, in the impression they
make, other flavors and odors being bigger and rounder.</p>

<p>The sensations derived from the inward organs are also
distinctly more or less voluminous. Repletion and emptiness,
suffocation, palpitation, headache, are examples of
this, and certainly not less spatial is the consciousness we
have of our general bodily condition in nausea, fever, heavy
drowsiness, and fatigue. Our entire cubic content seems
then sensibly manifest to us as such, and feels much larger
than any local pulsation, pressure, or discomfort. Skin
and retina are, however, the organs in which the space-element
plays the most active part. Not only does the
maximal vastness yielded by the retina surpass that yielded
by any other organ, but the intricacy with which our attention
can subdivide this vastness and perceive it to be composed
of lesser portions simultaneously coexisting alongside
of each other is without a parallel elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The
ear gives a greater vastness than the skin, but is considerably
less able to subdivide it.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Now my first thesis is that this element, discernible in each
and every sensation, though more developed in some than in
others, is the original sensation of space,</i> out of which all the
exact knowledge about space that we afterwards come to
have is woven by processes of discrimination, association,
and selection. 'Extensity,' as Mr. James Ward calls it,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
on this view, becomes an element in each sensation just as
intensity is. The latter every one will admit to be a distinguishable
though not separable ingredient of the sensible
quality. In like manner extensity, being an entirely peculiar
kind of feeling indescribable except in terms of itself,
and inseparable in actual experience from some sensational
quality which it must accompany, can itself receive no
other name than that of <i>sensational element</i>.</p>

<p>It must now be noted that <i>the vastness hitherto spoken of
is as great in one direction as in another</i>. Its dimensions are
so vague that in it there is no question as yet of surface
as opposed to depth; 'volume' being the best short name
for the sensation in question. <i>Sensations of different orders
are roughly comparable, inter se, with respect to their volumes.</i>
This shows that the spatial quality in each is identical
wherever found, for different qualitative elements, e.g.
warmth and odor, are incommensurate. Persons born
blind are reported surprised at the largeness with which
objects appear to them when their sight is restored. Franz
says of his patient cured of cataract: "He saw everything
much larger than he had supposed from the idea obtained
by his sense of touch. Moving, and especially living,
objects appeared very large."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Loud sounds have a certain
enormousness of feeling. It is impossible to conceive
of the explosion of a cannon as filling a small space. In
general, sounds seem to occupy all the room between us
and their source; and in the case of certain ones, the
cricket's song, the whistling of the wind, the roaring of the
surf, or a distant railway train, to have no definite starting
point.</p>

<p>In the sphere of vision we have facts of the same order.
'Glowing' bodies, as Hering says, give us a perception
"which seems <i>roomy</i> (<i>raumhaft</i>) in comparison with that
of strictly surface color. A glowing iron looks luminous
through and through, and so does a flame."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> A luminous
fog, a band of sunshine, affect us in the same way. As
Hering urges:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We must distinguish <i>roomy</i> from superficial, as well as distinctly
from indistinctly bounded, sensations. The dark which with closed eyes
one sees before one is, for example, a roomy sensation. We do not see
a black surface like a wall in front of us, but a space filled with darkness,
and even when we succeed in seeing this darkness as terminated
by a black wall there still remains in front of this wall the dark space.
The same thing happens when we find ourselves with open eyes in an
absolutely dark room. This sensation of darkness is also vaguely
bounded. An example of a distinctly bounded roomy sensation is that
of a clear and colored fluid seen in a glass; the yellow of the wine is
seen not only on the bounding surface of the glass; the yellow sensation
fills the whole interior of the glass. By day the so-called empty
space between us and objects seen appears very different from what it
is by night. The increasing darkness settles not only upon the things
but also <i>between</i> us and the things, so as at last to cover them completely
and fill the space alone. If I look into a dark box I find it <i>filled</i>
with darkness, and this is seen not merely as the dark-colored sides or
walls of the box. A shady corner in an otherwise well-lighted room is
full of a darkness which is not only <i>on</i> the walls and floor but <i>between</i>
them in the space they include. Every sensation is there where I experience
it, and if I have it at once at every point of a certain roomy
space, it is then a voluminous sensation. A cube of transparent green
glass gives us a spatial sensation; an opaque cube painted green, on
the contrary, only sensations of surface."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>There are certain quasi-motor sensations in the head</i> when
we change the direction of the attention, which equally seem
to involve three dimensions. If with closed eyes we think
of the top of the house and then of the cellar, of the distance
in front of us and then of that behind us, of space far to the
right and then far to the left, we have something far stronger
than an idea,&mdash;an actual feeling, namely, as if something in
the head moved into another direction. Fechner was, I
believe, the first to publish any remarks on these feelings.
He writes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When we transfer the attention from objects of one sense to those
of another we have an indescribable feeling (though at the same time
one perfectly determinate and reproducible at pleasure) of altered direction,
or differently localized tension (<i>Spannung</i>). We feel a strain forward
in the eyes, one directed sideways in the ears, increasing with
the degree of our attention, and changing according as we look at an
object carefully, or listen to something attentively; wherefore we speak
of <i>straining the attention</i>. The difference is most plainly felt when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the attention vibrates rapidly between eye and ear. This feeling localizes
itself with most decided difference in regard to the various sense-organs
according as we wish to discriminate a thing delicately by touch,
taste, or smell.</p>

<p>"But now I have, when I try to vividly recall a picture of memory
or fancy, a feeling perfectly analogous to that which I experience when
I seek to grasp a thing keenly by eye or ear; and this analogous feeling
is very differently localized. While in sharpest possible attention to
real objects (as well as to after-images) the strain is plainly forwards,
and, when the attention changes from one sense to another, only alters
its direction between the sense-organs, leaving the rest of the head free
from strain, the case is different in memory or fancy; for here the feeling
withdraws entirely from the external sense-organs, and seems rather
to take refuge in that part of the head which the brain fills. If I wish,
for example, to recall a place or person, it will arise before me with
vividness, not according as I strain my attention forwards, but rather
in proportion as I, so to speak, retract it backwards."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It appears probable that the feelings which Fechner describes
are in part constituted by imaginary semi-circular
canal sensations.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> These undoubtedly convey the most
delicate perception of change in direction; and when, as
here, the changes are not perceived as taking place in the
external world, they occupy a vague internal space located
within the head.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p>In the skin itself there is a vague form of projection
into the third dimension to which Hering has called attention.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Heat is not felt only against the cutaneous surface, but when communicated
through the air may appear extending more or less out from
the surface into the third dimension of surrounding space.... We
can determine in the dark the place of a radiant body by moving the
hand to and fro, and attending to the fluctuation of our feeling of
warmth. The feeling itself, however, is not projected fully into the
spot at which we localize the hot body, but always remains in the
neighborhood of the hand."</p></blockquote>

<p>The interior of one's mouth-cavity feels larger when explored
by the tongue than when looked at. The crater of a
newly-extracted tooth, and the movements of a loose tooth
in its socket, feel quite monstrous. A midge buzzing
against the drum of the ear will often seem as big as a butterfly.
The spatial sensibility of the tympanic membrane
has hitherto been very little studied, though the subject
will well repay much trouble. If we approach it by introducing
into the outer ear some small object like the tip of
a rolled-up tissue-paper lamplighter, we are surprised at
the large radiating sensation which its presence gives us,
and at the sense of clearness and openness which comes
when it is removed. It is immaterial to inquire whether
the far-reaching sensation here be due to actual irradiation
upon distant nerves or not. We are considering now, not
the objective causes of the spatial feeling, but its subjective
varieties, and the experiment shows that the same object
gives more of it to the inner than to the outer cuticle of
the ear. The pressure of the air in the tympanic cavity
upon the membrane gives an astonishingly large sensation.
We can increase the pressure by holding our nostrils and
closing our mouth and forcing air through our Eustachian
tubes by an expiratory effort; and we can diminish it by
either inspiring or swallowing under the same conditions of
closed mouth and nose. In either case we get a large round
tridimensional sensation inside of the head, which seems
as if it must come from the affection of an organ much
larger than the tympanic membrane, whose surface hardly
exceeds that of one's little-finger-nail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The tympanic membrane is furthermore able to render
sensible differences in the pressure of the external atmosphere,
too slight to be felt either as noise or in this more
violent way. If the reader will sit with closed eyes and let
a friend approximate some solid object, like a large book,
noiselessly to his face, he will immediately become aware
of the object's presence and position&mdash;likewise of its departure.
A friend of the writer, making the experiment
for the first time, discriminated unhesitatingly between the
three degrees of solidity of a board, a lattice-frame, and a
sieve, held close to his ear. Now as this sensation is never
used by ordinary persons as a means of perception, we may
fairly assume that its felt quality, in those whose attention
is called to it for the first time, belongs to it <i>quâ</i> sensation,
and owes nothing to educational suggestions. But this felt
quality is most distinctly and unmistakably one of vague
spatial vastness in three dimensions&mdash;quite as much so as
is the felt quality of the retinal sensation when we lie on
our back and fill the entire field of vision with the empty
blue sky. When an object is brought near the ear we immediately
feel shut in, contracted; when the object is
removed, we suddenly feel as if a transparency, clearness,
openness, had been made outside of us. And the feeling
will, by any one who will take the pains to observe it, be
acknowledged to involve the third dimension in a vague,
unmeasured state.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The reader will have noticed, in this enumeration of
facts, that <i>voluminousness of the feeling seems to bear very little
relation to the size of the organ that yields it</i>. The ear and
eye are comparatively minute organs, yet they give us feelings
of great volume. The same lack of exact proportion
between size of feeling and size of organ affected obtains
within the limits of particular sensory organs. An object
appears smaller on the lateral portions of the retina than it
does on the fovea, as may be easily verified by holding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
two forefingers parallel and a couple of inches apart, and
transferring the gaze of one eye from one to the other.
Then the finger not directly looked at will appear to shrink,
and this whatever be the direction of the fingers. On the
tongue a crumb, or the calibre of a small tube, appears
larger than between the fingers. If two points kept equidistant
(blunted compass- or scissors-points, for example)
be drawn across the skin so as really to describe a pair of
parallel lines, the lines will appear farther apart in some
spots than in others. If, for example, we draw them horizontally
across the face, so that the mouth falls between
them, the person experimented upon will feel as if they
began to diverge near the mouth and to include it in a well-marked
ellipse. In like manner, if we keep the compass-points
one or two centimetres apart, and draw them down
the forearm over the wrist and palm, finally drawing one
along one finger, the other along its neighbor, the appearance
will be that of a single line, soon breaking into two,
which become more widely separated below the wrist, to
contract again in the palm, and finally diverge rapidly
again towards the finger-tips. The dotted lines in Figs.
51 and 52 represent the true path of the compass-points;
the full lines their apparent path.</p>

</div>

<p>The same length of skin, moreover, will convey a more
extensive sensation according to the manner of stimulation.
If the edge of a card be pressed against the skin, the distance
between its extremities will seem shorter than that between
two compass-tips touching the same terminal points.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the eye, intensity of nerve-stimulation seems to increase
the <i>volume</i> of the feeling as well
as its brilliancy. If we raise and lower
the gas alternately, the whole room and
all the objects in it seem alternately to
enlarge and contract. If we cover half
a page of small print with a gray glass, the
print seen through the glass appears
decidedly smaller than that seen outside
of it, and the darker the glass the greater
the difference. When a circumscribed
opacity in front of the retina keeps off
part of the light from the portion which
it covers, objects projected on that
portion may seem but half as large as
when their image falls outside of it.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
The inverse effect seems produced by
certain drugs and anæsthetics. Morphine,
atropine, daturine, and cold blunt
the sensibility of the skin, so that distances
upon it seem less. Haschish produces
strange perversions of the general
sensibility. Under its influence one's
body may seem either enormously enlarged
or strangely contracted. Sometimes
a single member will alter its
proportion to the rest; or one's back,
for instance, will appear entirely absent,
as if one were hollow behind. Objects
comparatively near will recede to a vast
distance, a short street assume to the
eye an immeasurable perspective. Ether and chloroform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
occasionally produce not wholly dissimilar results. Panum,
the German physiologist, relates that when, as a boy, he
was etherized for neuralgia, the objects in the room grew
extremely small and distant, before his field of vision darkened
over and the roaring in his ears began. He also mentions
that a friend of his in church, struggling in vain to
keep awake, saw the preacher grow smaller and smaller
and more and more distant. I myself on one occasion
observed the same recession of objects during the beginning
of chloroformization. In various cerebral diseases
we find analogous disturbances.</p>

<p><i>Can we assign the physiological conditions which make the
elementary sensible largeness of one sensation vary so much from
that of another?</i> Only imperfectly. One factor in the result
undoubtedly is the number of nerve-terminations
simultaneously excited by the outward agent that awakens
the sensation. When many skin-nerves are warmed, or
much retinal surface illuminated, our feeling is larger than
when a lesser nervous surface is excited. The single sensation
yielded by two compass-points, although it seems
simple, is yet felt to be much bigger and blunter than that
yielded by one. The touch of a single point may always
be recognized by its quality of sharpness. This page looks
much smaller to the reader if he closes one eye than if both
eyes are open. So does the moon, which latter fact shows
that the phenomenon has nothing to do with parallax.
The celebrated boy couched for the cataract by Chesselden
thought, after his first eye was operated, "all things he saw
extremely large," but being couched of his second eye,
said "that objects at first appeared large to this eye, but
not so large as they did at first to the other; and looking
upon the same object with both eyes, he thought it looked
about twice as large as with the first couched eye only, but
not double, that we can anyways discover."</p>

<p>The greater extensiveness that the feeling of certain
parts of the same surface has over other parts, and that
one order of surface has over another (retina over skin, for
example), may also to a certain extent be explained by the
operation of the same factor. It is an anatomical fact that
the most spatially sensitive surfaces (retina, tongue, finger-tips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
etc.) are supplied by nerve-trunks of unusual thickness,
which must supply to every unit of surface-area an
unusually large number of terminal fibres. But the variations
of felt extension obey probably only a very rough law
of numerical proportion to the number of fibres. A sound
is not twice as voluminous to two ears as to one; and the
above-cited variations of feeling, when the same surface is
excited under different conditions, show that the feeling is
a resultant of several factors of which the anatomical one
is only the principal. Many ingenious hypotheses have
been brought forward to assign the co-operating factors
where different conditions give conflicting amounts of felt
space. Later we shall analyze some of these cases in detail,
but it must be confessed here in advance that many of
them resist analysis altogether.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<h4>THE PERCEPTION OF SPATIAL ORDER.</h4>


<p>So far, all we have established or sought to establish is
the existence of the vague form or <i>quale</i> of spatiality as an
inseparable element bound up with the other peculiarities
of each and every one of our sensations. The numerous
examples we have adduced of the variations of this extensive
element have only been meant to make clear its strictly
sensational character. In very few of them will the reader
have been able to explain the variation by an added intellectual
element, such as the suggestion of a recollected experience.
In almost all it has seemed to be the immediate
psychic effect of a peculiar sort of nerve-process excited;
and all the nerve-processes in question agree in yielding
what space they do yield, to the mind, in the shape of a
simple total vastness, in which, <i>primitively</i> at least, no <i>order
of parts</i> or of <i>subdivisions</i> reigns.</p>

<p>Let no one be surprised at this notion of a space without
order. There may be a space without order just as there
may be an order without space.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> And the primitive perceptions
of space are certainly of an unordered kind. The
order which the spaces first perceived potentially include
must, before being distinctly apprehended by the mind, be
woven into those spaces by a rather complicated set of intellectual
acts. The primordial largenesses which the sensations
yield must be <i>measured and subdivided</i> by consciousness,
and <i>added</i> together, before they can form by their
synthesis what we know as the real Space of the objective
world. In these operations, imagination, association, attention,
and selection play a decisive part; and although
they nowhere add any new material to the space-data of
sense, they so shuffle and manipulate these data and hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
present ones behind imagined ones that it is no wonder if
some authors have gone so far as to think that the sense-data
have no spatial worth at all, and that the intellect,
since it makes the subdivisions, also gives the spatial
quality to them out of resources of its own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As for ourselves, having found that all our sensations
(however as yet unconnected and undiscriminated) are of
extensive objects, <i>our next problem, is: How do we</i> <span class="smcap">arrange</span>
<i>these at first chaotically given spaces into the one regular and
orderly 'world of space' which we now know?</i></p>

<p>To begin with, there is no reason to suppose that the
several sense-spaces of which a sentient creature may
become conscious, each filled with its own peculiar content,
should tend, simply <i>because they are many</i>, to enter into
any definite spatial intercourse with each other, or lie in
any particular order of positions. Even in ourselves we
can recognize this. Different feelings may coexist in us
without assuming any particular spatial order. The sound
of the brook near which I write, the odor of the cedars, the
comfort with which my breakfast has filled me, and my interest
in this paragraph, all lie distinct in my consciousness,
but in no sense outside or alongside of each other. Their
spaces are interfused and at most fill the same vaguely objective
world. Even where the qualities are far less disparate,
we may have something similar. If we take our
subjective and corporeal sensations alone, there are moments
when, as we lie or sit motionless, we find it very difficult to
feel distinctly the length of our back or the direction of our
feet from our shoulders. By a strong effort we can succeed
in dispersing our attention impartially over our whole person,
and then we feel the real shape of our body in a sort
of unitary way. But in general a few parts are strongly
emphasized to consciousness and the rest sink out of notice;
and it is then remarkable how vague and ambiguous our
perception of their relative order of location is. Obviously,
for the orderly arrangement of a multitude of sense-spaces
in consciousness, something more than their mere separate
existence is required. What is this further condition?</p>

<p><i>If a number of sensible extents are to be perceived alongside</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
<i>of each other and in definite order they must appear as parts in
a vaster sensible extent which can enter the mind simply and all
at once</i>. I think it will be seen that the difficulty of estimating
correctly the form of one's body by pure feeling
arises from the fact that it is very hard to feel its totality as
a unit at all. The trouble is similar to that of thinking forwards
and backwards simultaneously. When conscious of
our head we tend to grow unconscious of our feet, and there
enters thus an element of time-succession into our perception
of ourselves which transforms the latter from an act of
intuition to one of construction. This element of constructiveness
is present in a still higher degree, and carries
with it the same consequences, when we deal with objective
spaces too great to be grasped by a single look. The relative
positions of the shops in a town, separated by many
tortuous streets, have to be thus constructed from data apprehended
in succession, and the result is a greater or less
degree of vagueness.</p>

<p>That a sensation <i>be discriminated as a part</i> from out of a
larger enveloping space is then the <i>conditio sine quâ non</i> of its
being apprehended in a definite spatial order. The problem
of ordering our feelings in space is then, in the first instance,
a problem of discrimination, but not of discrimination pure
and simple; for then not only coexistent sights but coexistent
sounds would necessarily assume such order, which
they notoriously do not. Whatever is discriminated will
appear as a small space within a larger space, it is true, but
this is but the very rudiment of order. For the location of
it within that space to become precise, other conditions still
must supervene; and the best way to study what they are
will be to pause for a little and <i>analyze what the expression
'spatial order' means</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Spatial order is an abstract term. The concrete perceptions
which it covers are figures, directions, positions, magnitudes,
and distances. To single out any one of these
things from a total vastness is partially to introduce order
into the vastness. To subdivide the vastness into a multitude
of these things is to apprehend it in a completely
orderly way. Now what are these things severally? To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
begin with, no one can for an instant hesitate to say that
some of them are qualities of sensation, just as the total
vastness is in which they lie. Take figure: a square, a
circle, and a triangle appear in the first instance to the eye
simply as three different kinds of impressions, each so peculiar
that we should recognize it if it were to return. When
Nunnely's patient had his cataracts removed, and a cube and
a sphere were presented to his notice, he could at once
perceive a difference in their shapes; and though he could
not say which was the cube and which the sphere, he saw
they were not of the same figure. So of lines: if we can
notice lines at all in our field of vision, it is inconceivable
that a vertical one should not affect us differently from an
horizontal one, and should not be recognized as affecting us
similarly when presented again, although we might not yet
know the name 'vertical,' or any of its connotations, beyond
this peculiar affection of our sensibility. So of angles: an
obtuse one affects our feeling immediately in a different way
from an acute one. Distance-apart, too, is a simple sensation&mdash;the
sensation of a line joining the two distant points:
lengthen the line, you alter the feeling and with it the
distance felt.</p>


<h4><i>Space-relations.</i></h4>


<p>But with distance and direction we pass to the category
of space-<i>relations</i>, and are immediately confronted by an
opinion which makes of all relations something <i>toto cœlo</i>
different from all facts of feeling or imagination whatsoever.
A relation, for the Platonizing school in psychology, is an
energy of pure thought, and, as such, is quite incommensurable
with the data of sensibility between which it may
be perceived to obtain.</p>

<p>We may consequently imagine a disciple of this school
to say to us at this point: "Suppose you <i>have</i> made a separate
specific sensation of each line and each angle, what
boots it? You have still the order of directions and of
distances to account for; you have still the relative magnitudes
of all these felt figures to state; you have their respective
positions to define before you can be said to have
brought order into your space. And not one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
determinations can be effected except through an act of relating
thought, so that your attempt to give an account of
space in terms of pure sensibility breaks down almost at
the very outset. <i>Position</i>, for example, can never be a sensation,
for it has nothing intrinsic about it; it can only
obtain <i>between</i> a spot, line, or other figure and <i>extraneous
co-ordinates</i>, and can never be an element of the sensible
datum, the line or the spot, in itself. Let us then confess
that Thought alone can unlock the riddle of space, and
that Thought is an adorable but unfathomable mystery."</p>

<p>Such a method of dealing with the problem has the
merit of shortness. Let us, however, be in no such hurry,
but see whether we cannot get a little deeper by patiently
considering what these space-relations are.</p>

<p>'Relation' is a very slippery word. It has so many
different concrete meanings that the use of it as an abstract
universal may easily introduce bewilderment into our
thought. We must therefore be careful to avoid ambiguity
by making sure, wherever we have to employ it, what its
precise meaning is in that particular sphere of application.
At present we have to do with space-relations, and no others.
Most 'relations' are feelings of an entirely different order
from the terms they relate. The relation of similarity, e.g.,
may equally obtain between jasmine and tuberose, or between
Mr. Browning's verses and Mr. Story's; it is itself
neither odorous nor poetical, and those may well be pardoned
who have denied to it all sensational content whatever.
But just as, in the field of quantity, the relation between
two numbers is another number, so <i>in the field of space the
relations are facts of the same order with the facts they relate.
If these latter be patches in the circle of vision, the former
are certain other patches between them.</i> When we speak of
the relation of direction of two points toward each other,
we mean simply the sensation of the line that joins the two
points together. <i>The line is the relation;</i> feel it and you
feel the relation, see it and you see the relation; nor can
you in any conceivable way think the latter except by imagining
the former (however vaguely), or describe or indicate
the one except by pointing to the other. And the
moment you have imagined the line, the relation stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
before you in all its completeness, with nothing further to
be done. Just so the relation of <i>direction</i> between two lines
is identical with the peculiar sensation of shape of the
space enclosed between them. This is commonly called
an angular relation.</p>

<p>If these relations are sensations, no less so are the relations
of position. <i>The relation of position between the top and
bottom points of a vertical line is that line,</i> and nothing else.
The relations of position between a point and a horizontal
line below it are potentially numerous. There is one more
important than the rest, called its distance. This is the
sensation, ideal or actual, of a perpendicular drawn from the
point to the line.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Two lines, one from each extremity of
the horizontal to the point, give us a peculiar sensation of
triangularity. This feeling may be said to constitute the
<i>locus</i> of all the relations of position of the elements in question.
<i>Rightness and leftness, upness and downness, are again
pure sensations</i> differing specifically from each other, and
generically from everything else. Like all sensations, they
can only be indicated, not described. If we take a cube and
label one side <i>top</i>, another <i>bottom</i>, a third <i>front</i>, and a fourth
<i>back</i>, there remains no form of words by which we can describe
to another person which of the remaining sides is <i>right</i>
and which <i>left</i>. We can only point and say <i>here</i> is right
and <i>there</i> is left, just as we should say <i>this</i> is red and <i>that</i>
blue. Of two points seen beside each other at all, one is
always affected by one of these feelings, and the other by
the opposite; the same is true of the extremities of any
line.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus it appears indubitable that all space-relations except
those of magnitude are nothing more or less than pure
sensational objects. But <i>magnitude</i> appears to outstep this
narrow sphere. We have relations of muchness and littleness
between times, numbers, intensities, and qualities, as
well as spaces. It is impossible, then, that such relations
should form a particular kind of simply spatial feeling.
This we must admit: the relation of quantity is generic
and occurs in many categories of consciousness, whilst the
other relations we have considered are specific and occur
in space alone. When our attention passes from a shorter
line to a longer, from a smaller spot to a larger, from a
feebler light to a stronger, from a paler blue to a richer,
from a march tune to a galop, the transition is accompanied
in the synthetic field of consciousness by a peculiar feeling
of difference which is what we call the sensation of <i>more</i>,&mdash;more
length, more expanse, more light, more blue, more
motion. This transitional sensation of <i>more</i> must be identical
with itself under all these different accompaniments,
or we should not give it the same name in every case. We
get it when we pass from a short vertical line to a long
horizontal one, from a small square to a large circle, as
well as when we pass between those figures whose shapes
are congruous. But when the shapes are congruous our
consciousness of the relation is a good deal more distinct,
and it is most distinct of all when, in the exercise of our
analytic attention, we notice, first, a <i>part</i>, and then the
<i>whole</i>, of a <i>single</i> line or shape. Then the <i>more</i> of the whole
actually sticks out, as a separate piece of space, and is so
envisaged. The same exact sensation of it is given when
we are able to superpose one line or figure on another. This
indispensable condition of exact measurement of the <i>more</i>
has led some to think that the feeling itself arose in every
case from original experiences of superposition. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
probably not an absolutely true opinion, but for our present
purpose that is immaterial. So far as the subdivisions
of a sense-space are to be <i>measured</i> exactly against each
other, objective forms occupying one subdivision must
directly or indirectly be superposed upon the other, and
the mind must get the immediate feeling of an outstanding
<i>plus</i>. And even where we only feel one subdivision to be
vaguely larger or less, the mind must pass rapidly between
it and the other subdivision, and receive the immediate sensible
shock of the <i>more</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>We seem thus to have accounted for all space-relations, and
made them clear to our understanding. They are nothing but
sensations of particular lines, particular angles, particular forms
of transition, or</i> (in the case of a <i>distinct more) of particular
outstanding portions of space after two figures have been superposed.</i>
These relation-sensations may actually be produced
as such, as when a geometer draws new lines across a figure
with his pencil to demonstrate the relations of its parts,
or they may be ideal representations of lines, not really
drawn. But in either case their entrance into the mind is
equivalent to a more detailed subdivision, cognizance, and
measurement of the space considered. <i>The bringing of subdivisions
to consciousness constitutes, then, the entire process
by which we pass from our first vague feeling of a total
vastness to a cognition of the vastness in detail.</i> The more
numerous the subdivisions are, the more elaborate and perfect
the cognition becomes. But inasmuch as all the subdivisions
are themselves sensations, and even the feeling
of 'more' or 'less' is, where not itself a figure, at least a
sensation of transition between two sensations of figure,
it follows, for aught we can as yet see to the contrary,
that <i>all spatial knowledge is sensational at bottom</i>, and that,
as the sensations lie together in the unity of consciousness,
no new material element whatever comes to them from a
supra-sensible source.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The bringing of subdivisions to consciousness! This, then,
is our next topic.</i> They may be brought to consciousness
under three aspects in respect of their <i>locality</i>, in respect
of their <i>size</i>, in respect of their <i>shape</i>.</p>


<h4><i>The Meaning of Localization.</i></h4>


<p><i>Confining ourselves to the problem of locality</i> for the present,
let us begin with the simple case of a sensitive surface,
only two points of which receive stimulation from without.
How, first, are these two points felt as alongside of each
other with an interval of space between them? We must
be conscious of two things for this: of the duality of the excited
points, and of the extensiveness of the unexcited
interval. The duality alone, although a necessary, is not a
sufficient condition of the spatial separation. We may,
for instance, discern two sounds in the same place, sweet
and sour in the same lemonade, warm and cold, round and
pointed contact in the same place on the skin, etc.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In all
discrimination the recognition of the duality of two feelings
by the mind is the easier the more strongly the feelings are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
contrasted in quality. If our two excited points awaken
identical qualities of sensation, they must, perforce, appear
to the mind as one; and, not distinguished at all, they are,
<i>a fortiori</i>, not localized apart. Spots four centimetres distant
on the back have no qualitative contrast at all, and fuse
into a single sensation. Points less than three thousandths
of a millimetre apart awaken on the retina sensations so
contrasted that we apprehend them immediately as two.
Now these unlikenesses which arise so slowly when we pass
from one point to another in the back, so much faster on
the tongue and finger-tips, but with such inconceivable
rapidity on the retina, what are they? Can we discover
anything about their intrinsic nature?</p>

<p>The most natural and immediate answer to make is that
they are unlikeness of <i>place</i> pure and simple. In the words
of a German physiologist,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> to whom psychophysics owes
much:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The sensations are from the outset (<i>von vornherein</i>) localized....
Every sensation as such is from the very beginning affected with the
spatial quality, so that this quality is nothing like an external attribute
coming to the sensation from a higher faculty, but must be regarded as
something immanently residing in the sensation itself."</p></blockquote>

<p>And yet the moment we reflect on this answer an insuperable
logical difficulty seems to present itself. No single
<i>quale</i> of sensation can, by itself, amount to a consciousness
of <i>position</i>. Suppose no feeling but that of a single point
ever to be awakened. Could that possibly be the feeling
of any special <i>whereness</i> or <i>thereness</i>? Certainly not. <i>Only
when a second point is felt to arise can the first one acquire
a determination of up, down, right or left, and these determinations
are all relative to that second point.</i> Each point, so far as
it is <i>placed, is</i> then only by virtue of what it <i>is not,</i> namely,
by virtue of another point. This is as much as to say that
position has nothing <i>intrinsic</i> about it; and that, although a
feeling of absolute bigness may, <i>a feeling of place cannot,
possibly form an immanent element in any single isolated sensation.</i>
The very writer we have quoted has given heed to
this objection, for he continues (p. 335) by saying that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
sensations thus originally localized "are only so <i>in themselves</i>,
but not in the representation of consciousness, which
is not yet present.... They are, in the first instance, devoid
of all mutual relations with each other." But such a
localization of the sensation 'in itself' would seem to mean
nothing more than the susceptibility or <i>potentiality</i> of being
distinctly localized when the time came and other conditions
became fulfilled. Can we now discover anything about such
susceptibility in itself before it has borne its ulterior fruits
in the developed consciousness?</p>


<h4><i>'Local Signs.'</i></h4>


<p>To begin with, every sensation of the skin and every visceral
sensation seems to derive from its topographic seat
a peculiar shade of feeling, which it would not have in
another place. And this feeling <i>per se</i> seems quite another
thing from the perception of the place. Says Wundt<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If with the finger we touch first the cheek and then the palm,
exerting each time precisely the same pressure, the sensation shows notwithstanding
a distinctly marked difference in the two cases. Similarly,
when we compare the palm with the back of the hand, the nape of the
neck with its anterior surface, the breast with the back; in short, any
two distant parts of the skin with each other. And moreover, we easily
remark, by attentively observing, that spots even tolerably close
together differ in respect of the quality of their feeling. If we pass
from one point of our cutaneous surface to another, we find a perfectly
gradual and continuous alteration in our feeling, notwithstanding the
objective nature of the contact has remained the same. Even the sensations
of corresponding points on opposite sides of the body, though
similar, are not identical. If, for instance, we touch first the back of one
hand and then of the other, we remark a qualitative unlikeness of
sensation. It must not be thought that such differences are mere matters
of imagination, and that we take the sensations to be different
because we represent each of them to ourselves as occupying a different
place. With sufficient sharpening of the attention, we may, confining
ourselves to the quality of the feelings alone, entirely abstract from
their locality, and yet notice the differences quite as markedly."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>Whether these local contrasts shade into each other
with absolutely continuous gradations, we cannot say. But
we know (continues Wundt) that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"they change, when we pass from one point of the skin to its neighbor,
with very different degrees of rapidity. On delicately-feeling
parts, used principally for touching, such as the finger-tips, the difference
of sensation between two closely approximate points is already
strongly pronounced; whilst in parts of lesser delicacy, as the arm, the
back, the legs, the disparities of sensation are observable only between
distant spots."</p></blockquote>

<p>The internal organs, too, have their specific <i>qualia</i> of sensation.
An inflammation of the kidney is different from
one of the liver; pains in joints and muscular insertions
are distinguished. Pain in the dental nerves is wholly
unlike the pain of a burn. But very important and curious
similarities prevail throughout these differences. Internal
pains, whose seat we cannot see, and have no means of
knowing unless the character of the pain itself reveal it,
are felt <i>where</i> they belong. Diseases of the stomach,
kidney, liver, rectum, prostate, etc., of the bones, of the
brain and its membranes, are referred to their proper position.
Nerve-pains describe the length of the nerve. Such
localizations as those of vertical, frontal, or occipital headache
of intracranial origin force us to conclude that parts
which are neighbors, whether inner or outer, may possess
by mere virtue of that fact a common peculiarity of feeling,
a respect in which their sensations agree, and which serves
as a token of their proximity. These <i>local</i> colorings are,
moreover, so strong that we cognize them as the same,
throughout all contrasts of sensible quality in the accompanying
perception. Cold and heat are wide as the poles
asunder; yet if both fall on the cheek, there mixes with
them something that makes them in <i>that respect</i> identical;
just as, contrariwise, despite the identity of cold with itself
wherever found, when we get it first on the palm and then
on the cheek, some difference comes, which keeps the two
experiences for ever asunder.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>And now let us revert to the query propounded a
moment since: <i>Can these differences of mere quality in feeling,
varying according to locality yet having each sensibly and intrinsically
and by itself nothing to do with position, constitute
the 'susceptibilities' we mentioned, the conditions of being perceived
in position, of the localities to which they belong?</i> The
numbers on a row of houses, the initial letters of a set of
words, have no intrinsic kinship with points of space, and
yet they are the conditions of our knowledge of where any
house is in the row, or any word in the dictionary. Can the
modifications of feeling in question be tags or labels of this
kind which in no wise originally reveal the position of the
spot to which they are attached, but guide us to it by what
Berkeley would call a 'customary tie'? Many authors have
unhesitatingly replied in the affirmative; Lotze, who in his
Medizinische Psychologie<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> first described the sensations in
this way, designating them, thus conceived, as <i>local-signs</i>.
This term has obtained wide currency in Germany, and <i>in
speaking of the</i> <span class="smcap">'local-sign theory'</span> <i>hereafter, I shall always
mean the theory which denies that there can be in a sensation any
element of actual locality, of inherent spatial order,</i> any tone as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
it were which cries to us immediately and without further
ado, 'I am <i>here</i>,' or 'I am <i>there</i>.'</p>

<p>If, as may well be the case, we by this time find ourselves
tempted to accept the Local-sign theory in a general
way, we have to clear up several farther matters. If a sign
is to lead us to <i>the thing</i> it means, we must have some other
source of knowledge of that thing. Either the thing has
been given in a previous experience of which the sign also
formed part&mdash;they are <i>associated</i>; or it is what Reid calls a
'natural' sign, that is, a feeling which, the first time it
enters the mind, evokes from the native powers thereof a
cognition of the thing that hitherto had lain dormant. In
both cases, however, the sign is one thing, and the thing
another. In the instance that now concerns us, <i>the sign is
a quality of feeling and the thing is a position</i>. Now we have
seen that the position of a point is not only revealed, but
created, by the existence of other points to which it stands
in determinate <i>relations. If the sign can by any machinery
which it sets in motion evoke a consciousness either of the other
points, or of the relations, or of both, it would seem to fulfil its
function, and reveal to us the position we seek.</i></p>

<p>But such a machinery is already familiar to us. It is
neither more nor less than the law of habit in the nervous
system. When any point of the sensitive surface has been
frequently excited simultaneously with, or immediately
before or after, other points, and afterwards comes to be
excited alone, there will be a tendency for its perceptive
nerve-centre to irradiate into the nerve-centres of the other
points. Subjectively considered, this is the same as if we
said that <i>the peculiar feeling of the first point</i> <span class="smcap">suggests</span> <i>the
feeling of the entire region with whose stimulation its own excitement
has been habitually</i> <span class="smcap">associated</span>.</p>

<p>Take the case of the stomach. When the epigastrium
is heavily pressed, when certain muscles contract, etc., the
stomach is squeezed, and its peculiar local sign awakes in
consciousness simultaneously with the local signs of the
other squeezed parts. There is also a sensation of total
vastness aroused by the combined irritation, and <i>somewhere</i>
in this the stomach-feeling seems to lie. Suppose that
later a pain arises in the stomach from some non-mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
cause. It will be tinged by the gastric local sign, and
the nerve-centre supporting this latter feeling will excite
the centre supporting the dermal and muscular feelings
habitually associated with it when the excitement was
mechanical. From the combination the same peculiar
vastness will again arise. In a word, 'something' in the
stomach-sensation 'reminds' us of a total space, of which
the diaphragmatic and epigastric sensations also form a
part, or, to express it more briefly still, suggests the neighborhood
of these latter organs.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Revert to the case of two excited points on a surface with
an unexcited space between them. The general result of
previous experience has been that when either point was
impressed by an outward object, the same object also
touched the immediately neighboring parts. Each point,
together with its local sign, is thus associated with a circle
of surrounding points, the association fading in strength as
the circle grows larger. Each will revive its own circle;
but when both are excited together, the strongest revival
will be that due to the <i>combined</i> irradiation. Now the tract
<i>joining the two excited points</i> is the only part common to the
two circles. And the feelings of this whole tract will therefore
awaken with considerable vividness in the imagination
when its extremities are touched by an outward irritant.
The mind receives with the impression of the two distinct
points the vague idea of a line. The twoness of the points
comes from the contrast of their local signs: the line comes
from the associations into which experience has wrought
these latter. If no ideal line arises we have duality without
sense of interval; if the line be excited actually rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
than ideally, we have the interval given with its ends, in
the form of a single extended object felt. E. H. Weber, in
the famous article in which he laid the foundations of all
our accurate knowledge of these subjects, <i>laid it down as
the logical requisite for the perception of two separated points,
that the mind should, along with its consciousness of them, become
aware of an unexcited interval as such. I have only tried
to show how the known laws of experience may cause this requisite
to be fulfilled.</i> Of course, if the local signs of the entire
region offer but little qualitative contrast <i>inter se</i>, the line
suggested will be but dimly defined or discriminated in
length or direction from other possible lines in its neighborhood.
This is what happens in the back, where consciousness
can sunder two spots, whilst only vaguely apprehending
their distance and direction apart.</p>

<p>The relation of position of the two points <i>is</i> the suggested
interval or line. Turn now to the simplest case,
that of <i>a single excited spot. How can it suggest its position?</i>
Not by recalling any particular line unless experience have
constantly been in the habit of marking or tracing some one
line from it towards some one neighboring point. Now
on the back, belly, viscera, etc., no such tracing habitually
occurs. The consequence is that the only suggestion is
that of the whole neighboring circle; i.e., <i>the spot simply
recalls the general region in which it happens to lie.</i> By a process
of successive construction, it is quite true that we can
also get the feeling of distance between the spot and some
other particular spot. Attention, by reinforcing the local
sign of one part of the circle, can awaken a new circle
round this part, and so <i>de proche en proche</i> we may slide our
feeling down from our cheek, say, to our foot. But when
we first touched our cheek we had no consciousness of the
foot at all.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> In the extremities, the lips, the tongue and
other mobile parts, the case is different. We there have
an instinctive tendency, when a part of lesser discriminative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
sensibility is touched, to move the member so that the
touching object glides along it to the place where sensibility
is greatest. If a body touches our hand we move the
hand over it till the finger-tips are able to explore it. If
the sole of our foot touches anything we bring it towards
the toes, and so forth. There thus arise lines of habitual
passage from all points of a member to its sensitive tip.
These are the lines most readily recalled when any point
is touched, and their recall is identical with the consciousness
of the distance of the touched point from the 'tip.' I
think anyone must be aware when he touches a point of
his hand or wrist that it is the relation to the finger-tips of
which he is usually most conscious. Points on the forearm
suggest either the finger-tips or the elbow (the latter
being a spot of greater sensibility<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>). In the foot it is the
toes, and so on. A point can only be cognized in its relations
to the entire body at once by awakening a <i>visual</i>
image of the whole body. Such awakening is even more
obviously than the previously considered cases a matter of
pure association.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>This leads us to the eye.</i> On the retina the fovea and the
yellow spot about it form a focus of exquisite sensibility,
towards which every impression falling on an outlying portion
of the field is moved by an instinctive action of the
muscles of the eyeball. Few persons, until their attention
is called to the fact, are aware how almost impossible it is
to keep a conspicuous visible object in the margin of the
field of view. The moment volition is relaxed we find that
without our knowing it our eyes have turned so as to bring
it to the centre. This is why most persons are unable to
keep the eyes steadily converged upon a point in space with
nothing in it. The objects against the walls of the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
invincibly attract the foveæ to themselves. If we contemplate
a blank wall or sheet of paper, we always observe in
a moment that we are directly looking at some speck upon it
which, unnoticed at first, ended by 'catching our eye.' Thus
<i>whenever an image falling on the point P of the retina excites
attention, it more habitually moves from that point towards the
fovea than in any one other direction.</i> The line traced thus by
the image is not always a straight line. When the direction
of the point from the fovea is neither vertical nor horizontal
but oblique, the line traced is often a curve, with its concavity
directed upwards if the direction is upwards, downwards
if the direction is downwards. This may be verified
by anyone who will take the trouble to make a simple experiment
with a luminous body like a candle-flame in a dark
enclosure, or a star. Gazing first at some point remote
from the source of light, let the eye be suddenly turned full
upon the latter. The luminous image will necessarily fall
in succession upon a continuous series of points, reaching
from the one first affected to the fovea. But by virtue of
the slowness with which retinal excitements die away, the
entire series of points will for an instant be visible as an
after-image, displaying the above peculiarity of form according
to its situation.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> These radiating lines are neither
regular nor invariable in the same person, nor, probably,
equally curved in different individuals. We are incessantly
drawing them between the fovea and every point of the
field of view. Objects remain in their peripheral indistinctness
only so long as they are unnoticed. The moment we
attend to them they grow distinct through one of these motions&mdash;which
leads to the idea prevalent among uninstructed
persons that we see distinctly all parts of the field of view
at once. <i>The result of this incessant tracing of radii is that
whenever a local sign P is awakened by a spot of light falling
upon it, it recalls forthwith, even though the eyeball be unmoved,
the local signs of all the other points which lie between P and
the fovea.</i> It recalls them in imaginary form, just as the
normal reflex movement would recall them in vivid form;
and with their recall is given a consciousness more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
faint of the whole line on which they lie. In other words,
no ray of light can fall on any retinal spot without the local
sign of that spot revealing to us, by recalling the line
of its most habitual associates, its direction and distance
from the centre of the field. The fovea acts thus as the
origin of a system of polar co-ordinates, in relation to which
each and every retinal point has through an incessantly-repeated
process of association its distance and direction determined.
Were <i>P</i> alone illumined and all the rest of the
field dark we should still, even with motionless eyes, know
whether <i>P</i> lay high or low, right or left, through the <i>ideal
streak</i>, different from all other streaks, which <i>P</i> alone
has the power of awakening.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>And with this we can close the first great division of
our subject. We have shown that, within the range of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
every sense, experience takes <i>ab initio</i> the spatial form. We
have also shown that in the cases of the retina and skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
every sensible total may be subdivided by discriminative
attention into sensible parts, which are also spaces, and
into relations between the parts, these being sensible spaces
too. Furthermore, we have seen (in <a href="#Footnote_167_167">note 167</a>) that different
parts, once discriminated, necessarily fall into a determinate
order, both by reason of definite gradations in their
quality, and by reason of the fixed order of time-succession
in which movements arouse them. But in all this
nothing has been said of the comparative <i>measurement</i> of
one sensible space-total against another, or of the way
in which, by summing our divers simple sensible space-experiences
together, we end by constructing what we regard
as the unitary, continuous, and infinite objective Space
of the real world. To this more difficult inquiry we next
pass.</p>


<h4>THE CONSTRUCTION OF 'REAL' SPACE.</h4>


<p>The problem breaks into two subordinate problems.</p>

<p>(1) <i>How is the subdivision and measurement of the several
sensorial spaces completely effected?</i> and</p>

<p>(2) <i>How do their mutual addition and fusion and reduction
to the same scale, in a word, how does their synthesis, occur?</i></p>

<p>I think that, as in the investigation just finished, we
found ourselves able to get along without invoking any data
but those that pure sensibility on the one hand, and the
ordinary intellectual powers of discrimination and recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
on the other, were able to yield; so here we shall
emerge from our more complicated quest with the conviction
that all the facts can be accounted for on the supposition
that no other mental forces have been at work save
those we find everywhere else in psychology: sensibility,
namely, for the data; and discrimination, association,
memory, and choice for the rearrangements and combinations
which they undergo.</p>


<h4>1. <i>The Subdivision of the Original Sense-spaces.</i></h4>


<p>How are spatial subdivisions brought to consciousness?
in other words, How does spatial discrimination occur?
The general subject of discrimination has been treated in
a previous chapter. Here we need only inquire what are
the conditions that make spatial discrimination so much
finer in sight than in touch, and in touch than in hearing,
smell, or taste.</p>

<p><i>The first great condition is, that different points of the
surface shall differ in the quality of their immanent sensibility,</i>
that is, that each shall carry its special local-sign. If the
skin felt everywhere exactly alike, a foot-bath could be distinguished
from a total immersion, as being smaller, but
never distinguished from a wet face. The local-signs are
indispensable; two points which have the same local-sign
will always be felt as the same point. We do not judge
them two unless we have discerned their sensations to be
different.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Granted none but homogeneous irritants, that
organ would then distinguish the greatest multiplicity of
irritants&mdash;would count most stars or compass-points, or
best compare the size of two wet surfaces&mdash;whose local
sensibility was the least even. A skin whose sensibility
shaded rapidly off from a focus, like the apex of a boil,
would be better than a homogeneous integument for spatial
perception. The retina, with its exquisitely sensitive fovea,
has this peculiarity, and undoubtedly owes to it a great part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of the minuteness with which we are able to subdivide the
total bigness of the sensation it yields. On its periphery
the local differences do not shade off very rapidly, and we
can count there fewer subdivisions.</p>

<p><i>But these local differences of feeling, so long as the surface
is unexcited from without, are almost null.</i> I cannot feel them
by a pure mental act of attention unless they belong to quite
distinct parts of the body, as the nose and the lip, the finger-tip
and the ear; their contrast needs the reinforcement of
outward excitement to be felt. In the spatial muchness of
a colic&mdash;or, to call it by the more spacious-sounding vernacular,
of a 'bellyache'&mdash;one can with difficulty distinguish
the north-east from the south-west corner, but can do so
much more easily if, by pressing one's finger against the
former region, one is able to make the pain there more intense.</p>

<p><i>The local differences require then an adventitious sensation,
superinduced upon them, to awaken the attention.</i> After
the attention has once been awakened in this way, it may
continue to be conscious of the unaided difference; just as
a sail on the horizon may be too faint for us to notice until
someone's finger, placed against the spot, has pointed it out
to us, but may then remain visible after the finger has been
withdrawn. But all this is true only on condition that
separate points of the surface may be <i>exclusively</i> stimulated.
If the whole surface at once be excited from without, and
homogeneously, as, for example, by immersing the body in
salt water, local discrimination is not furthered. The local-signs,
it is true, all awaken at once; but in such multitude
that no one of them, with its specific quality, stands out in
contrast with the rest. If, however, a single extremity be
immersed, the contrast between the wet and dry parts is
strong, and, at the surface of the water especially, the local-signs
attract the attention, giving the feeling of a ring surrounding
the member. Similarly, two or three wet spots
separated by dry spots, or two or three hard points against
the skin, will help to break up our consciousness of the
latter's bigness. In cases of this sort, where points receiving
an identical kind of excitement are, nevertheless,
felt to be locally distinct, and the objective irritants are also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
judged multiple,&mdash;e.g., compass-points on skin or stars on
retina,&mdash;the ordinary explanation is no doubt just, and we
judge the outward causes to be multiple because we have
discerned the local feelings of their sensations to be different.</p>

<p><i>Capacity for partial stimulation is thus the second condition
favoring discrimination.</i> A sensitive surface which has to
be excited in all its parts at once can yield nothing but a
sense of undivided largeness. This appears to be the case
with the olfactory, and to all intents and purposes with the
gustatory, surfaces. Of many tastes and flavors, even simultaneously
presented, each affects the totality of its respective
organ, each appears with the whole vastness given
by that organ, and appears interpenetrated by the rest.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p>I should have been willing some years ago to name without
hesitation a third condition of discrimination&mdash;saying it
would be most developed in that organ which is susceptible
of the <i>most various qualities</i> of feeling. The retina is unquestionably
such an organ. The colors and shades it
perceives are infinitely more numerous than the diversities
of skin-sensation. And it can feel at once white and black,
whilst the ear can in nowise so feel sound and silence. But
the late researches of Donaldson, Blix, and Goldscheider,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
on specific points for heat, cold, pressure, and pain in the
skin; the older ones of Czermak (repeated later by Klug
in Ludwig's laboratory), showing that a hot and a cold
compass-point are no more easily discriminated as two than
two of equal temperature; and some unpublished experiments
of my own&mdash;all disincline me to make much of this
condition now.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> There is, however, one quality of sensation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
which is particularly exciting, and that is the <i>feeling
of motion over any of our surfaces</i>. The erection of this
into a separate elementary quality of sensibility is one of
the most recent of psychological achievements, and is
worthy of detaining us a while at this point.</p>


<h4><i>The Sensation of Motion over Surfaces.</i></h4>


<p><i>The feeling of motion</i> has generally been assumed by
physiologists to be impossible until the positions of <i>terminus
a quo</i> and <i>terminus ad quem</i> are severally cognized, and the
successive occupancies of these positions by the moving
body are perceived to be separated by a distinct interval of
time.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> As a matter of fact, however, we cognize only the
very slowest motions in this way. Seeing the hand of a
clock at XII and afterwards at VI, we judge that it has
moved through the interval. Seeing the sun now in the
east and again in the west, I infer it to have passed over
my head. But we can only <i>infer</i> that which we already
generically know in some more direct fashion, and it is experimentally
certain that we have the feeling of motion
given us as a direct and simple <i>sensation</i>. Czermak long ago
pointed out the difference between seeing the motion of the
second-hand of a watch, when we look directly at it, and
noticing the fact of its having altered its position when we
fix our gaze upon some other point of the dial-plate. In
the first case we have a specific quality of sensation which
is absent in the second. If the reader will find a portion
of his skin&mdash;the arm, for example&mdash;where a pair of compass-points
an inch apart are felt as one impression, and if
he will then trace lines a tenth of an inch long on that spot
with a pencil-point, he will be distinctly aware of the point's
motion and vaguely aware of the direction of the motion.
The perception of the motion here is certainly not derived
from a pre-existing knowledge that its starting and ending
points are separate positions in space, because positions in
space ten times wider apart fail to be discriminated as such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
when excited by the dividers. It is the same with the
retina. One's fingers when cast upon its peripheral portions
cannot be counted&mdash;that is to say, the five retinal tracts
which they occupy are not distinctly apprehended by the
mind as five separate positions in space&mdash;and yet the slightest
<i>movement</i> of the fingers is most vividly perceived as
movement and nothing else. It is thus certain that our
sense of movement, being so much more delicate than our
sense of position, cannot possibly be derived from it. <i>A
curious observation by Exner</i><a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> completes the proof that movement
is a primitive form of sensibility, by showing it to be
much more delicate than our sense of succession in time.
This very able physiologist caused two electric sparks to
appear in rapid succession, one beside the other. The
observer had to state whether the right-hand one or the
left-hand one appeared first. When the interval was reduced
to as short a time as 0.044'' the discrimination of
temporal order in the sparks became impossible. But
Exner found that if the sparks were brought so close together
in space that their irradiation-circles overlapped, the
eye then felt their flashing as if it were the motion of a
single spark from the point occupied by the first to the
point occupied by the second, and the time-interval might
then be made as small as 0.015'' before the mind began to
be in doubt as to whether the apparent motion started
from the right or from the left. On the skin similar experiments
gave similar results.</p>

<p><i>Vierordt, at almost the same time,</i><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> <i>called attention to certain
persistent illusions, amongst which are these:</i> If another
person gently trace a line across our wrist or finger, the
latter being stationary, it will feel to us as if the member
were moving in the opposite direction to the tracing
point. If, on the contrary, we move our limb across a fixed
point, it will be seen as if the point were moving as well.
If the reader will touch his forehead with his forefinger
kept motionless, and then rotate the head so that the skin
of the forehead passes beneath the finger's tip, he will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
an irresistible sensation of the latter being itself in motion
in the opposite direction to the head. So in abducting the
fingers from each other; some may move and the rest be still
still, but the still ones will feel as if they were actively separating
from the rest. These illusions, according to Vierordt,
are survivals of a primitive form of perception, when
motion was felt as such, but ascribed to the whole content
of consciousness, and not yet distinguished as belonging exclusively
to one of its parts. When our perception is fully
developed we go beyond the mere relative motion of thing
and ground, and can ascribe absolute motion to one of these
components of our total object, and absolute rest to another.
When, in vision for example, the whole background moves
together, we think that it is ourselves or our eyes which
are moving; and any object in the foreground which may
move relatively to the background is judged by us to be
still. But primitively this discrimination cannot be perfectly
made. The sensation of the motion spreads over all
that we see and infects it. Any relative motion of object
and retina both makes the object seem to move, and makes
us feel ourselves in motion. Even now when our whole object
moves we still get giddy; and we still see an apparent
motion of the entire field of view, whenever we suddenly
jerk our head and eyes or shake them quickly to and fro.
Pushing our eyeballs gives the same illusion. We <i>know</i> in
all these cases what really happens, but the conditions are
unusual, so our primitive sensation persists unchecked. So
it does when clouds float by the moon. We <i>know</i> the moon
is still; but we <i>see</i> it move even faster than the clouds.
Even when we slowly move our eyes the primitive sensation
persists under the victorious conception. If we notice
closely the experience, we find that any object towards
which we look appears moving to meet our eye.</p>

<p>But the most valuable contribution to the subject is
the paper of G. H. Schneider,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> who takes up the matter
zoologically, and shows by examples from every branch of
the animal kingdom that movement is the quality by which
animals most easily attract each other's attention. The instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of 'shamming death' is no shamming of death at all,
but rather a paralysis through fear, which saves the insect,
crustacean, or other creature from being <i>noticed at all</i> by his
enemy. It is parallelled in the human race by the breath-holding
stillness of the boy playing 'I spy,' to whom the
seeker is near; and its obverse side is shown in our involuntary
waving of arms, jumping up and down, and so forth,
when we wish to attract someone's attention at a distance.
Creatures 'stalking' their prey and creatures hiding from
their pursuers alike show how immobility diminishes conspicuity.
In the woods, if we are quiet, the squirrels and
birds will actually touch us. Flies will light on stuffed
birds and stationary frogs.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> On the other hand, the tremendous
shock of feeling the thing we are sitting on begin
to move, the exaggerated start it gives us to have an insect
unexpectedly pass over our skin, or a cat noiselessly come
and snuffle about our hand, the excessive reflex effects of
tickling, etc., show how exciting the sensation of motion is
<i>per se</i>. A kitten cannot help pursuing a moving ball. Impressions
too faint to be cognized at all are immediately
felt if they move. A fly sitting is unnoticed,&mdash;we feel it the
moment it crawls. A shadow may be too faint to be perceived.
As soon as it moves, however, we see it. Schneider
found that a shadow, with distinct outline, and directly fixated,
could still be perceived when moving, although its
objective strength might be but half as great as that of a
stationary shadow so faint as just to disappear. With a
blurred shadow in indirect vision the difference in favor
of motion was much greater&mdash;namely, 13.3:40.7. If we
hold a finger between our closed eyelid and the sunshine
we shall not notice its presence. The moment we move it
to and fro, however, we discern it. Such visual perception
as this reproduces the conditions of sight among the
radiates.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>Enough has now been said to show that <i>in the education
of spatial discrimination the motions of impressions across sensory
surfaces must have been the principal agent</i> in breaking
up our consciousness of the surfaces into a consciousness
of their parts. Even to-day the main function of the peripheral
regions of our retina is that of sentinels, which,
when beams of light move over them, cry 'Who goes there?'
and call the fovea to the spot. Most parts of the skin do
but perform the same office for the finger-tips. Of course
finger-tips and fovea leave <i>some</i> power of direct perception
to marginal retina and skin respectively. But it is worthy
of note that such perception is best developed on the skin of
the most movable parts (the labors of Vierordt and his
pupils have well shown this); and that in the blind, whose
skin is exceptionally discriminative, it seems to have become
so through the inveterate habit which most of them possess
of twitching and moving it under whatever object may
touch them, so as to become better acquainted with the conformation
of the same. Czermak was the first to notice this.
It may be easily verified. Of course <i>movement of surface
under object is (for purposes of stimulation) equivalent to movement
of object over surface.</i> In exploring the shapes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
sizes of things by either eye or skin the movements of these
organs are incessant and unrestrainable. Every such movement
draws the points and lines of the object across the
surface, imprints them a hundred times more sharply,
and drives them home to the attention. The immense part
thus played by movements in our perceptive activity is held
by many psychologists<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> to prove that the muscles are themselves
the space-perceiving organ. Not surface-sensibility,
but 'the muscular sense,' is for these writers the original
and only revealer of objective extension. But they have
all failed to notice with what peculiar intensity muscular
contractions call surface-sensibilities into play, and that the
mere discrimination of impressions (quite apart from any
question of measuring the space between them) largely
depends on the mobility of the surface upon which they
fall.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<h4>2. <i>The Measurement of the sense-spaces against each other.</i></h4>


<p>What precedes is all we can say in answer to the problem
of discrimination. Turn now to that of measurement of the
several spaces against each other, that being the first step
in our constructing out of our diverse space-experiences the
one space we believe in as that of the real world.</p>

<p>The first thing that seems evident is that we have no
<i>immediate</i> power of comparing together with any accuracy
the extents revealed by different sensations. Our mouth-cavity
feels indeed to itself smaller, and to the tongue
larger, than it feels to the finger or eye, our tympanic
membrane feels larger than our finger-tip, our lips feel
larger than a surface equal to them on our thigh. So much
comparison is immediate; but it is vague; and for anything
exact we must resort to other help.</p>

<p><i>The great agent in comparing the extent felt by one sensory
surface with that felt by another, is superposition&mdash;superposition
of one surface upon another, and superposition of one outer
thing upon many surfaces.</i> Thus are exact equivalencies and
common measures introduced, and the way prepared for
numerical results.</p>

<p>Could we not superpose one part of our skin upon another,
or one object on both parts, we should hardly succeed
in coming to that knowledge of our own form which
we possess. The original differences of bigness of our different
parts would remain vaguely operative, and we should
have no certainty as to how much lip was equivalent to so
much forehead, how much finger to so much back.</p>

<p>But with the power of exploring one part of the surface
by another we get a direct perception of cutaneous equivalencies.
The primitive differences of bigness are overpowered
when we feel by an immediate sensation that a
certain length of thigh-surface is in contact with the entire
palm and fingers. And when a motion of the opposite finger-tips
draws a line first along this same length of thigh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
then along the whole of the hand in question, we get a new
manner of measurement, less direct but confirming the
equivalencies established by the first. In these ways, by
superpositions of parts and by tracing lines on different
parts by identical movements, a person deprived of sight
can soon learn to reduce all the dimensions of his body to a
homogeneous scale. By applying the same methods to
objects of his own size or smaller, he can with equal ease
make himself acquainted with their extension stated in
terms derived from his own bulk, palms, feet, cubits, spans,
paces, fathoms (armspreads), etc. In these reductions it is
to be noticed that <i>when the resident sensations of largeness
of two opposed surfaces conflict, one of the sensations is chosen
as the true standard and the other treated as illusory. Thus
an empty tooth-socket is believed to be</i> really smaller than
the finger-tip which it will not admit, although it may <i>feel</i>
larger; and in general it may be said that the hand, as the
almost exclusive organ of palpation, gives its own magnitude
to the other parts, instead of having its size determined by
them. In general, it is, as Fechner says, the extent felt by
the more sensitive part to which the other extents are reduced.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>But even though exploration of one surface by another
were impossible, we could always measure our various
surfaces against each other by applying the same extended
object first to one and then to another. We should of
course have the alternative of supposing that the object
itself waxed and waned as it glided from one place to
another (cf. above, <a href="#Page_141">p. 141</a>); but the principle of simplifying
as much as possible our world would soon drive us out of
that assumption into the easier one that objects as a rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
keep their sizes, and that most of our sensations are
affected by errors for which a constant allowance must be
made.</p>

<p>In the retina there is no reason to suppose that the
bignesses of two impressions (lines or blotches) falling on
different regions are primitively felt to stand in any exact
mutual ratio. It is only when the impressions come from
the <i>same object</i> that we judge their sizes to be the same.
And this, too, only when the relation of the object to the
eye is believed to be on the whole unchanged. When the
object by moving changes its relations to the eye the sensation
excited by its image even on the same retinal region
becomes so fluctuating that we end by ascribing no absolute
import whatever to the retinal space-feeling which at any
moment we may receive. So complete does this overlooking
of retinal magnitude become that it is next to impossible
to compare the visual magnitudes of objects at different
distances without making the experiment of superposition.
We cannot say beforehand how much of a distant house or
tree our finger will cover. The various answers to the
familiar question, How large is the moon?&mdash;answers which
vary from a cartwheel to a wafer&mdash;illustrate this most
strikingly. The hardest part of the training of a young
draughtsman is his learning to feel directly the retinal (i.e.
primitively sensible) magnitudes which the different objects
in the field of view subtend. To do this he must recover
what Ruskin calls the 'innocence of the eye'&mdash;that is, a
sort of childish perception of stains of color merely as
such, without consciousness of what they mean.</p>

<p>With the rest of us this innocence is lost. <i>Out of all the
visual magnitudes of each known object we have selected one as
the</i> <span class="smcap">real</span> <i>one to think of, and degraded all the others to serve as
its signs</i>. This 'real' magnitude is determined by æsthetic
and practical interests. It is that which we get when the
object is at the distance most propitious for exact visual
discrimination of its details. This is the distance at which
we hold anything we are examining. Farther than this we
see it too small, nearer too large. And the larger and the
smaller feeling vanish in the act of suggesting this one,
their more important <i>meaning</i>. As I look along the dining-table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
I overlook the fact that the farther plates and glasses
<i>feel</i> so much smaller than my own, for I <i>know</i> that they are
all equal in size; and the feeling of them, which is a present
sensation, is eclipsed in the glare of the knowledge, which
is a merely imagined one.</p>

<p>If the inconsistencies of sight-spaces <i>inter se</i> can thus be
reduced, of course there can be no difficulty in equating
sight-spaces with spaces given to touch. In this equation
it is probably the touch-feeling which prevails as real and
the sight which serves as sign&mdash;a reduction made necessary
not only by the far greater constancy of felt over seen
magnitudes, but by the greater practical interest which the
sense of touch possesses for our lives. As a rule, things
only benefit or harm us by coming into direct contact with
our skin: sight is only a sort of anticipatory touch; the
latter is, in Mr. Spencer's phrase, the 'mother-tongue of
thought,' and the handmaid's idiom must be translated
into the language of the mistress before it can speak clearly
to the mind.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Later on we shall see that the feelings excited in the
joints when a limb moves are used as signs of the path
traversed by the extremity. But of this more anon. As
for the equating of sound-, smell-, and taste-volumes with
those yielded by the more discriminative senses, they are
too vague to need any remark. It may be observed of
pain, however, that its size has to be reduced to that of the
normal tactile size of the organ which is its seat. A finger
with a felon on it, and the pulses of the arteries therein, both
'feel' larger than we believe they really 'are.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>It will have been noticed in the account given that
<i>when two sensorial space-impressions, believed to come from the
same object, differ, then</i> <span class="smcap">the one most interesting,</span> <i>practically
or æsthetically</i>, <span class="smcap">is judged to be the true one</span>. This law of
interest holds throughout&mdash;though a permanent interest,
like that of touch, may resist a strong but fleeting one like
that of pain, as in the case just given of the felon.</p>


<h4>3. <i>The Summation of the Sense-spaces.</i></h4>


<p>Now for the next step in our construction of real space:
<i>How are the various sense-spaces added together into a
consolidated and unitary continuum?</i> For they are, in man
at all events, incoherent at the start.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here again the first fact that appears is that <i>primitively
our space-experiences form a chaos, out of which we have no
immediate faculty for extricating them. Objects of different
sense-organs, experienced together, do not in the first instance
appear either inside or alongside or far outside of each other,
neither spatially continuous nor discontinuous, in any definite
sense of these words.</i> The same thing is almost as true of
objects felt by different parts of the same organ before
discrimination has done its finished work. The most we
can say is that all our space-experiences together form an
<i>objective total</i> and that this <i>objective total</i> is vast.</p>

<p>Even now the space inside our mouth, which is so intimately
known and accurately measured by its inhabitant
the tongue, can hardly be said to have its internal directions
and dimensions known in any exact relation to those
of the larger world outside. It forms almost a little world
by itself. Again, when the dentist excavates a small cavity
in one of our teeth, we feel the hard point of his instrument
scraping, in distinctly differing directions, a surface which
seems to our sensibility vaguely larger than the subsequent
use of the mirror tells us it 'really' is. And though the
directions of the scraping differ so completely <i>inter se</i>, not
one of them can be identified with the particular direction
in the outer world to which it corresponds. The space of
the tooth-sensibility is thus really a little world by itself,
which can only become congruent with the outer space-world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
by farther experiences which shall alter its bulk,
identify its directions, fuse its margins, and finally imbed it
as a definite part within a definite whole. And even though
every joint's rotations should be felt to vary <i>inter se</i> as so
many differences of direction in a common room; even
though the same were true of diverse tracings on the skin,
and of diverse tracings on the retina respectively, it would
still not follow that feelings of direction, on these different
surfaces, are intuitively comparable among each other, or
with the other directions yielded by the feelings of the
semi-circular canals. It would not follow that we should
immediately judge the relations of them all to each other
in one space-world.</p>

<p>If with the arms in an unnatural attitude we 'feel'
things, we are perplexed about their shape, size, and
position. Let the reader lie on his back with his arms
stretched above his head, and it will astonish him to find
how ill able he is to recognize the geometrical relations of
objects placed within reach of his hands. But the geometrical
relations here spoken of are nothing but identities
recognized between the directions and sizes perceived in
this way and those perceived in the more usual ways.
The two ways do not fit each other intuitively.</p>

<p>How lax the connection between the system of visual and
the system of tactile directions is in man, appears from the
facility with which microscopists learn to reverse the movements
of their hand in manipulating things on the stage of
the instrument. To move the slide to the <i>seen</i> left they
must draw it to the <i>felt</i> right. But in a very few days the
habit becomes a second nature. So in tying our cravat,
shaving before a mirror, etc., the right and left sides are
inverted, and the directions of our hand movements are the
opposite of what they seem. Yet this never annoys us.
Only when by accident we try to tie the cravat of another
person do we learn that there are two ways of combining
sight and touch perceptions. Let any one try for the first
time to write or draw while looking at the image of his
hand and paper in a mirror, and he will be utterly bewildered.
But a very short training will teach him to undo
in this respect the associations of his previous lifetime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Prisms show this in an even more striking way. If the
eyes be armed with spectacles containing slightly prismatic
glasses with their bases turned, for example, towards the
right, every object looked at will be apparently translocated
to the left; and the hand put forth to grasp any such object
will make the mistake of passing beyond it on the left side.
But less than an hour of practice in wearing such spectacles
rectifies the judgment so that no more mistakes are made.
In fact the new-formed associations are already so strong,
that when the prisms are first laid aside again the opposite
error is committed, the habits of a lifetime violated, and
the hand now passed to the right of every object which it
seeks to touch.</p>

<p>The primitive chaos thus subsists to a great degree
through life so far as our immediate sensibility goes. We
feel our various objects and their bignesses, together or in
succession; but so soon as it is a question of the order and
relations of many of them at once our intuitive apprehension
remains to the very end most vague and incomplete.
Whilst we are attending to one, or at most to two or three
objects, all the others <i>lapse</i>, and the most we feel of them is
that they still linger on the outskirts and can be caught
again by turning in a certain way. Nevertheless <i>throughout
all this confusion we conceive of a world spread out in a perfectly
fixed and orderly fashion, and we believe in its existence. The
question is: How do this conception and this belief arise? How
is the chaos smoothed and straightened out?</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mainly by two operations: Some of the experiences are
apprehended to exist out- and alongside of each other, and
others are apprehended to interpenetrate each other, and
to occupy the same room. In this way what was incoherent
and irrelative ends by being coherent and definitely related;
nor is it hard to trace the principles, by which the mind is
guided in this arrangement of its perceptions, in detail.</p>

<p>In the first place, following the great intellectual law of
economy, we simplify, unify, and identify as much as we
possibly can. <i>Whatever sensible data can be attended to together
we locate together. Their several extents seem one extent. The
place at which each appears is held to be the same with the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
at which the others appear. They become, in short, so many
properties of</i> <span class="smcap">one and the same real thing</span>. This is the first
and great commandment, the fundamental 'act' by which
our world gets spatially arranged.</p>

<p>In this <i>coalescence in a 'thing</i>,' one of the coalescing
sensations is held to <i>be</i> the thing, the other sensations are
taken for its more or less accidental <i>properties</i>, or modes of
appearance.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The sensation chosen to be the thing essentially
is the most constant and practically important of the
lot; most often it is hardness or weight. But the hardness
or weight is never without tactile bulk; and as we can
always see something in our hand when we feel something
there, we equate the bulk felt with the bulk seen, and thenceforward
this common bulk is also apt to figure as of the
essence of the 'thing.' Frequently a shape so figures,
sometimes a temperature, a taste, etc.; but for the most part
temperature, smell, sound, color, or whatever other phenomena
may vividly impress us simultaneously with the bulk
felt or seen, figure among the accidents. Smell and sound
impress us, it is true, when we neither see nor touch the
thing; but they are strongest when we see or touch, so we
locate the <i>source</i> of these properties within the touched or
seen space, whilst the properties themselves we regard as
overflowing in a weakened form into the spaces filled by
other things. <i>In all this, it will be observed, the sense-data
whose spaces coalesce into one are yielded by different sense-organs.</i>
Such data have no tendency to displace each other
from consciousness, but can be attended to together all at
once. Often indeed they vary concomitantly and reach a
maximum together. We may be sure, therefore, that the
general rule of our mind is to locate <span class="smcap">in</span> <i>each other all</i> sensations
which are associated in simultaneous experience, and
do not interfere with each other's perception.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Different impressions on the same sense-organ</i> do interfere
with each other's perception, and cannot well be attended
to at once. Hence <i>we do not locate them in each other's spaces,
but arrange them in a serial order of exteriority, each alongside
of the rest, in a space larger than that which any one sensation
brings.</i> This larger space, however, is an object of conception
rather than of direct intuition, and bears all the marks
of being constructed piecemeal by the mind. The blind
man forms it out of tactile, locomotor, and auditory experiences,
the seeing man out of visual ones almost exclusively.
As the visual construction is the easiest to understand,
let us consider that first.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Every single visual sensation or 'field of view' is
limited. To get a new field of view for our object the old
one must disappear. But the disappearance may be only
partial. Let the first field of view be A B C. If we carry
our attention to the limit C, it ceases to be the limit, and
becomes the centre of the field, and beyond it appear fresh
parts where there were none before:<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> A B C changes, in
short, to C D E. But although the parts A B are lost to
sight, yet their image abides in the memory; and if we think
of our first object A B C as having existed or as still existing
at all, we must think of it as it was originally presented,
namely, as spread out from C in one direction just as C D E
is spread out in another. A B and D E can never coalesce
in one place (as they could were they objects of different
senses) because they can never be perceived at once: we
must lose one to see the other. So (the letters standing
now for 'things') we get to conceive of the successive fields
of things after the analogy of the several things which we
perceive in a single field. They must be out- and alongside
of each other, and we conceive that their juxtaposed
spaces must make a larger space. A B C + C D E must,
in short, be imagined to exist in the form of A B C D E or
not imagined at all.</p>

<p>We can usually recover anything lost from sight by
moving our attention and our eyes back in its direction; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
through these constant changes every field of seen things
comes at last to be thought of as always having a fringe
of <i>other things possible to be seen</i> spreading in all directions
round about it. Meanwhile the movements concomitantly
with which the various fields alternate are also felt and remembered;
and gradually (through association) this and
that movement come in our thought to suggest this or that
extent of fresh objects introduced. Gradually, too, since
the objects vary indefinitely in kind, we abstract from
their several natures and think separately of their mere
extents, of which extents the various movements remain as
the only constant introducers and associates. More and
more, therefore, do we think of movement and seen extent
as mutually involving each other, until at last (with Bain
and J. S. Mill) we may get to regard them as synonymous,
and say, "What is the <i>meaning of the word extent</i>, unless it
be possible movement?"<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> We forget in this conclusion
that (whatever intrinsic extensiveness the movements may
appear endowed with), that seen spreadoutness which is
the pattern of the abstract extensiveness which we imagine
came to us originally from the retinal sensation.</p>

<p>The muscular sensations of the eyeball <i>signify</i> this sort
of visible spreadoutness, just as this visible spreadoutness
may come in later experience to <i>signify</i> the 'real' bulks,
distances, lengths and breadths known to touch and locomotion.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
To the very end, however, in us seeing men,
the quality, the nature, the <i>sort of thing we mean</i> by extensiveness,
would seem to be the sort of feeling which our retinal
stimulations bring.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In one deprived of sight the principles by which the
notion of real space is constructed are the same. Skin-feelings
take in him the place of retinal feelings in giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the quality of lateral spreadoutness, as our attention passes
from one extent of them to another, awakened by an object
sliding along. Usually the moving object is our hand;
and feelings of movement in our joints invariably accompany
the feelings in the skin. But the feeling of the skin
is what the blind man <i>means</i> by his skin; so the size of the
skin-feelings stands as the absolute or real size, and the
size of the joint-feelings becomes a sign of these. Suppose,
for example, a blind baby with (to make the description
shorter) a blister on his toe, exploring his leg with his
finger-tip and feeling a pain shoot up sharply the instant
the blister is touched. The experiment gives him four
different kinds of sensation&mdash;two of them protracted, two
sudden. The first pair are the movement-feeling in the
joints of the upper limb, and the movement-feeling on
the skin of the leg and foot. These, attended to together,
have their extents identified as one objective space&mdash;the
hand moves through the same space in which the
leg lies. The second pair of objects are the pain in the
blister, and the peculiar feeling the blister gives to the
finger. Their spaces also fuse; and as each marks the end
of a peculiar movement-series (arm moved, leg stroked),
the movement-spaces are <i>emphatically</i> identified with each
other at <i>that</i> end. Were there other small blisters distributed
down the leg, there would be a number of these
emphatic points; the movement-spaces would be identified,
not only as totals, but point for point.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>Just so with spaces beyond the body's limits. Continuing
the joint-feeling beyond the toe, the baby hits another
object, which he can still think of when he brings his hand
back to its blister again. That object at the end of that
joint-feeling means a new place for him, and the more such
objects multiply in his experience the wider does the space
of his conception grow. If, wandering through the woods
to-day by a new path, I find myself suddenly in a glade
which affects my senses exactly as did another I reached
last week at the end of a different walk, I believe the two
identical affections to present the same persisting glade,
and infer that I have attained it by two differing roads.
The spaces walked over grow congruent by their extremities;
though apart from the common sensation which those
extremities give me, I should be under no necessity of connecting
one walk with another at all. The case in no whit
differs when shorter movements are concerned. If, moving
first one arm and then another, the blind child gets the
same kind of sensation upon the hand, and gets it again
as often as he repeats either process, he judges that he has
touched the same object by both motions, and concludes
that the motions terminate in a common place. From place
to place marked in this way he moves, and adding the
places moved through, one to another, he builds up his notion
of the extent of the outer world. The seeing man's
process is identical; only his units, which may be successive
bird's-eye views, are much larger than in the case of
the blind.</p>

<h4>FEELINGS IN JOINTS AND FEELINGS IN MUSCLES.</h4>

<h4>1. <i>Feelings of Movement in Joints.</i></h4>


<p>I have been led to speak of feelings which arise in
joints. As these feelings have been too much neglected in
Psychology hitherto, in entering now somewhat minutely
into their study I shall probably at the same time freshen
the interest of the reader, which under the rather dry abstractions
of the previous pages may presumably have
flagged.</p>

<p>When, by simply flexing my right forefinger on its metacarpal
joint, I trace with its tip an inch on the palm of my
left hand, is my feeling of the size of the inch purely and
simply a feeling in the skin of the palm, or have the muscular
contractions of the right hand and forearm anything
to do with it? In the preceding pages I have constantly
assumed spatial sensibility to be an affair of surfaces. At
first starting, the consideration of the 'muscular sense' as
a space-measurer was postponed to a later stage. Many
writers, of whom the foremost was Thomas Brown, in his
<i>Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind</i>, and of whom
the latest is no less a Psychologist than Prof. Delbœuf,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
hold that the consciousness of active muscular motion,
aware of its own amount, is the <i>fons et origo</i> of all spatial
measurement. It would seem to follow, if this theory were
true, that two skin-feelings, one of a large patch, one of a
small one, possess their difference of spatiality, not as an
immediate element, but solely by virtue of the fact that the
large one, to get its points <i>successively</i> excited, demands
more muscular contraction than the small one does. Fixed
associations with the several amounts of muscular contraction
required in this particular experience would thus explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the apparent sizes of the skin-patches, which sizes
would consequently not be primitive data but derivative results.</p>

<p><i>It seems to me that no evidence of the muscular measurements
in question exists;</i> but that all the facts may be explained
by surface-sensibility, provided we take that of the
joint-surfaces also into account.</p>

<p>The most striking argument, and the most obvious one,
which an upholder of the muscular theory is likely to produce
is undoubtedly this fact: if, with closed eyes, we trace
figures in the air with the extended forefinger (the motions
may occur from the metacarpal-, the wrist-, the elbow-, or
the shoulder-joint indifferently), what we are <i>conscious of</i> in
each case, and indeed most acutely conscious of, is the
geometric path described by the finger-tip. Its angles, its
subdivisions, are all as distinctly felt as if seen by the eye;
and yet the surface of the finger-tip receives no impression
at all.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> But with each variation of the figure, the muscular
contractions vary, and so do the feelings which these yield.
Are not these latter the sensible data that make us aware of
the lengths and directions we discern in the traced line?</p>

<p>Should we be tempted to object to this supposition of
the advocate of perception by muscular feelings, that we
have <i>learned</i> the spatial significance of these feelings by
reiterated experiences of <i>seeing</i> what figure is drawn when
each special muscular grouping is felt, so that in the last
resort the muscular space feelings would be derived from
retinal-surface feelings, our opponent might immediately
hush us by pointing to the fact that in persons born blind
the phenomenon in question is even more perfect than in
ourselves.</p>

<p>If we suggest that the blind may have originally traced
the figures on the cutaneous surface of cheek, thigh, or palm,
and may now remember the specific figure which each present
movement formerly caused the skin-surface to perceive,
he may reply that the delicacy of the motor perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
far exceeds that of most of the cutaneous surfaces;
that, in fact, we can feel a figure traced only in its differentials,
so to speak,&mdash;a figure which we merely <i>start</i> to trace by
our finger-tip, a figure which, traced in the same way <i>on</i> our
finger-tip by the hand of another, is almost if not wholly
unrecognizable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The champion of the muscular sense seems likely to be
triumphant <i>until we invoke the articular cartilages</i>, as internal
surfaces whose sensibility is called in play by every
movement we make, however delicate the latter may be.</p>

<p>To establish the part they play in our geometrizing, it
is necessary to review a few facts. It has long been known
by medical practitioners that, in patients with cutaneous
anæsthesia of a limb, whose muscles also are insensible to
the thrill of the faradic current, a very accurate sense of the
way in which the limb may be flexed or extended by the
hand of another may be preserved.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> On the other hand,
we may have this sense of movement impaired when the tactile
sensibility is well preserved. That the pretended feeling
of outgoing innervation can play in these cases no part, is
obvious from the fact that the movements by which the
limb changes its position are passive ones, imprinted on it
by the experimenting physician. The writers who have
sought a <i>rationale</i> of the matter have consequently been
driven by way of exclusion to assume the articular surfaces
to be the seat of the perception in question.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p><i>That the joint-surfaces are sensitive</i> appears evident from
the fact that in inflammation they become the seat of excruciating
pains, and from the perception by everyone who
lifts weights or presses against resistance, that every increase
of the force opposing him betrays itself to his consciousness
principally by the starting-out of new feelings
or the increase of old ones, in or about the joints. If the
structure and mode of mutual application of two articular
surfaces be taken into account, it will appear that, granting
the surfaces to <i>be</i> sensitive, no more favorable mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
conditions could be possible for the delicate calling of the
sensibility into play than are realized in the minutely graduated
rotations and firmly resisted variations of pressure
involved in every act of extension or flexion. Nevertheless
it is a great pity that we have as yet no direct testimony,
no expressions from patients with healthy joints accidentally
laid open, of the impressions they experience when the
cartilage is pressed or rubbed.</p>

<p>The first approach to direct evidence, so far as I know,
is contained in the paper of Lewinski,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> published in 1879.
This observer had a patient the inner half of whose leg
was anæsthetic. When this patient stood up, he had a
curious illusion about the position of his limb, which disappeared
the moment he lay down again: he thought himself
<i>knock-kneed</i>. If, as Lewinski says, we assume the inner
half of the joint to share the insensibility of the corresponding
part of the skin, then he <i>ought</i> to feel, when the
joint-surfaces pressed against each other in the act of
standing, the outer half of the joint most strongly. But
this is the feeling he would also get whenever it was by any
chance sought to force his leg into a knock-kneed attitude.
Lewinski was led by this case to examine the feet of certain
ataxic patients with imperfect sense of position. He
found in every instance that when the toes were flexed <i>and
drawn upon</i> at the same time (the joint-surfaces drawn
asunder) all sense of the amount of flexion disappeared.
On the contrary, when he pressed a toe <i>in</i>, whilst flexing it,
the patient's appreciation of the amount of flexion was
much improved, evidently because the artificial increase of
articular pressure made up for the pathological insensibility
of the parts.</p>

<p>Since Lewinski's paper an important experimental research
by A. Goldscheider<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> has appeared, which completely
establishes our point. This patient observer caused his
fingers, arms, and legs to be passively rotated upon their
various joints in a mechanical apparatus which registered
both the velocity of movement impressed and the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of angular rotation. No active muscular contraction took
place. The minimal felt amounts of rotation were in all cases
surprisingly small, being much less than a single angular degree
in all the joints except those of the fingers. Such displacements
as these, the author says (p. 490), can hardly be
detected by the eye. The point of application of the force
which rotated the limb made no difference in the result.
Rotations round the hip-joint, for example, were as delicately
felt when the leg was hung by the heel as when it
was hung by the thigh whilst the movements were performed.
Anæsthesia of the skin produced by induction-currents
also had no disturbing effect on the perception, nor
did the various degrees of pressure of the moving force
upon the skin affect it. It became, in fact, all the more
distinct in proportion as the concomitant pressure-feelings
were eliminated by artificial anæsthesia. When the joints
themselves, however, were made artificially anæsthetic the
perception of the movement grew obtuse and the angular
rotations had to be much increased before they were perceptible.
All these facts prove according to Herr Goldscheider,
that <i>the joint surfaces and these alone are the starting
point of the impressions by which the movements of our
members are immediately perceived.</i></p>

<p>Applying this result, which seems invulnerable, to the
case of the tracing finger-tip, we see that our perception of
the latter gives no countenance to the theory of the muscular
sense. <i>We indubitably localize the finger-tip at the successive
points of its path by means of the sensations which we
receive from our joints.</i> But if this is so, it may be asked,
why do we feel the figure to be traced, not within the joint
itself, but in such an altogether different place? And why
do we feel it so much larger than it really is?</p>

<p>I will answer these questions by asking another: Why
do we move our joints at all? Surely to gain something
more valuable than the insipid joint-feelings themselves.
And these more interesting feelings are in the main produced
upon the <i>skin</i> of the moving part, or of some other
part over which it passes, or upon the eye. With movements
of the fingers we explore the configuration of all real
objects with which we have to deal, our own body as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
foreign things. Nothing that interests us is located in the
joint; everything that interests us either <i>is</i> some part of
our skin, or is something that we see as we handle it. The
cutaneously felt and the seen extents come thus to figure
as the important things for us to concern ourselves with.
Every time the joint moves, even though we neither see,
nor feel cutaneously, the reminiscence of skin-events and
sights which formerly coincided with that extent of movement,
ideally awaken as the movement's import, and the
mind drops the present sign to attend to the import alone.
The joint-sensation itself, as such, does not disappear in
the process. A little attention easily detects it, with all
its fine peculiarities, hidden beneath its vaster suggestions;
so that really the mind has two space-perceptions before
it, congruent in form but different in scale and place, either
of which exclusively it may notice, or both at once,&mdash;the
joint-space which it <i>feels</i> and the real space which it <i>means</i>.</p>

<p>The joint-spaces serve so admirably as signs because of
their capacity for <i>parallel variation</i> to all the peculiarities
of external motion. There is not a direction in the real
world nor a ratio of distance which cannot be matched by
some direction or extent of joint-rotation. Joint-feelings,
like all feelings, are roomy. Specific ones are contrasted
<i>inter se</i> as different directions are contrasted within the
same extent. If I extend my arm straight out at the
shoulder, the rotation of the shoulder-joint will give me one
feeling of movement; if then I sweep the arm forward, the
same joint will give me another feeling of movement.
Both these movements are felt to happen in space, and
differ in specific quality. Why shall not the specificness
of the quality just consist in the feeling of a peculiar <i>direction?</i><a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
Why may not the several joint-feelings <i>be</i> so many
perceptions of movement in so many different directions?
That we cannot explain why they <i>should</i> is no presumption
that they <i>do</i> not, for we never can explain why any sense-organ
should awaken the sensation it does.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>
<p>But if the joint-feelings are directions and extents,
standing in relation to each other, the task of association in
interpreting their import in eye- or skin-terms is a good deal
simplified. Let the movement <i>bc</i>, of a certain joint, derive
its absolute space-value from the cutaneous feeling it is
always capable of engendering; then the longer movement
<i>abcd</i> of the same joint will be judged to have a greater
space-value, even though it may never have wholly merged
with a skin-experience. So of differences of direction: so
much joint-difference = so much skin-difference; therefore,
more joint-difference = more skin-difference. <i>In fact, the
joint-feeling can excellently serve as a map on a reduced scale, of
a reality which the imagination can identify at its pleasure
with this or that sensible extension simultaneously known in
some other way.</i></p>

<p>When the joint-feeling in itself acquires an emotional
interest,&mdash;which happens whenever the joint is inflamed
and painful,&mdash;the secondary suggestions fail to arise, and
the movement is felt where it is, and in its intrinsic scale of
magnitude.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The localization of the joint-feeling in a space simultaneously
known otherwise (i.e. to eye or skin), is what is
commonly called the <i>extradition or eccentric projection of the
feeling</i>. In the preceding chapter I said a good deal on this
subject; but we must now see a little more closely just what
happens in this instance of it. The content of the joint-feeling,
to begin with, is an object, and <i>is</i> in itself a place.
For it to be <i>placed</i>, say <i>in the elbow</i>, the elbow as seen or handled
must already have become another object for the mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and with its place as thus known, the place which the joint-feeling
fills must coalesce. That the latter should be felt
'in the elbow' is therefore a 'projection' of it into the place
of another object as much as its being felt in the finger-tip
or at the end of a cane can be. But when we say 'projection'
we generally have in our mind the notion of a <i>there</i> as
contrasted with a <i>here</i>. What is the <i>here</i> when we say that the
joint-feeling is <i>there</i>? The 'here' seems to be the spot
which the mind has chosen for its own post of observation,
usually some place within the head, but sometimes within
the throat or breast&mdash;not a rigorously fixed spot, but a
region from any portion of which it may send forth its various
acts of attention. Extradition from either of <i>these</i>
regions is the common law under which we perceive the
whereabouts of the north star, of our own voice, of the contact
of our teeth with each other, of the tip of our finger,
of the point of our cane on the ground, or of a movement
in our elbow-joint.</p>

<p>But <i>for the distance between the 'here' and the 'there' to be
felt, the entire intervening space must be itself an object of perception.</i>
The consciousness of this intervening space is the
<i>sine quâ non</i> of the joint-feeling's projection to the farther
end of it. When it is filled by our own bodily tissues (as
where the projection only goes as far as the elbow or finger-tip)
we are sensible of its extent alike by our eye, by
our exploring movements, and by the resident sensations
which fill its length. When it reaches beyond the limits
of our body, the resident sensations are lacking, but limbs
and hand and eye suffice to make it known. Let me, for
example, locate a feeling of motion coming from my elbow-joint
in the point of my cane a yard beyond my hand.
Either I see this yard as I flourish the cane, and the seen
end of it then absorbs my sensation just as my seen elbow
might absorb it, or I am blind and imagine the cane as an
object continuing my arm, either because I have explored
both arm and cane with the other hand, or because I have
pressed them both along my body and leg. If I project my
joint-feeling farther still, it is by a conception rather than a
distinct imagination of the space. I <i>think</i>: 'farther,' 'thrice
as far,' etc.; and thus get a symbolic image of a distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
path at which I point.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> But the 'absorption' of the joint-feeling
by the distant spot, in whatever terms the latter
may be apprehended, is never anything but that coalescence
into one 'thing' already spoken of on <a href="#Page_184">page 184</a>, of
whatever different sensible objects interest our attention at
once.</p>


<h4>2. <i>Feelings of Muscular Contraction.</i></h4>


<p>Readers versed in psychological literature will have
missed, in our account thus far, the usual invocation of
'the muscular sense.' This word is used with extreme
vagueness to cover all resident sensations, whether of
motion or position, in our members, and even to designate
the supposed feeling of efferent discharge from the brain.
We shall later see good reason to deny the existence of the
latter feeling. We have accounted for the better part at least
of the resident feelings of motion in limbs by the sensibility
of the articular surfaces. The skin and ligaments also must
have feelings awakened as they are stretched or squeezed
in flexion or extension. And I am inclined to think that
<i>the sensations of our contracting muscles themselves probably play
as small a part in building up our exact knowledge of space as
any class of sensations which we possess.</i> The muscles, indeed,
play an all-important part, but it is through the remote
effect of their contractions on other sensitive parts, not
through their own resident sensations being aroused. In
other words, <i>muscular contraction is only indirectly instrumental,
in giving us space-perceptions, by its effects on surfaces.</i>
In skin and retina it produces a motion of the stimulus
upon the surface; in joints it produces a motion of the
surfaces upon each other&mdash;such motion being by far the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
most delicate manner of exciting the surfaces in question.
One is tempted to doubt whether the muscular sensibility
as such plays even a subordinate part as <i>sign</i> of these
more immediately geometrical perceptions which are so
uniformly associated with it as effects of the contraction
objectively viewed.</p>

<p>For this opinion many reasons can be assigned. First,
it seems <i>a priori</i> improbable that such organs as muscles
should give us feelings whose variations bear any exact
proportion to the spaces traversed when they contract.
As G. E. Müller says,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> their sensory nerves must be excited
either chemically or by mechanical compression whilst the
contractions last, and in neither case can the excitement be
proportionate to the position into which the limb is thrown.
The chemical state of the muscle depends on the <i>previous</i>
work more than on the actually present contraction; and
the internal pressure of it depends on the resistance offered
more than on the shortening attained. <i>The intrinsic muscular
sensations are likely therefore to be merely those of massive
strain or fatigue, and to carry no accurate discrimination with
them of lengths of path moved through.</i></p>

<p>Empirically we find this probability confirmed by many
facts. The judicious A. W. Volkmann observes<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Muscular feeling gives tolerably fine evidence as to the <i>existence</i>
of movement, but hardly any direct information about its extent or
direction. We are not aware that the contractions of a <i>supinator
longus</i> have a wider range than those of a <i>supinator brevis</i>; and that
the fibres of a bipenniform muscle contract in opposite directions is a fact
of which the muscular feeling itself gives not the slightest intimation.
Muscle-feeling belongs to that class of general sensations which tell us
of our inner states, but not of outer relations; it does not belong among
the space-perceiving senses."</p></blockquote>

<p>E. H. Weber in his article Tastsinn called attention
to the fact that muscular movements as large and strong
as those of the diaphragm go on continually without our
perceiving them as motion.</p>

<p>G. H. Lewes makes the same remark. When we think
of our muscular sensations as movements in space, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
because we have ingrained with them in our imagination a
movement on a surface simultaneously felt.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thus whenever we breathe there is a contraction of the muscles
of the ribs and the diaphragm. Since we <i>see</i> the chest expanding, we
know it as a movement and can only think of it as such. But the diaphragm
itself is not seen, and consequently by no one who is not physiologically
enlightened on the point is this diaphragm thought of in
movement. Nay, even when told by a physiologist that the diaphragm
moves at each breathing, every one who has not seen it moving downward
pictures it as an upward movement, because the chest moves
upward."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A personal experience of my own seems strongly to corroborate
this view. For years I have been familiar, during
the act of gaping, with a large, round, smooth sensation in
the region of the throat, a sensation characteristic of gaping
and nothing else, but which, although I had often
wondered about it, never suggested to my mind the motion
of anything. The reader probably knows from his own
experience exactly what feeling I mean. It was not till one
of my students told me, that I learned its objective cause.
If we look into the mirror while gaping, we see that at the
moment we have this feeling the hanging palate <i>rises</i> by
the contraction of its intrinsic muscles. The contraction
of these muscles and the compression of the palatine mucous
membrane are what occasion the feeling; and I was
at first astonished that, coming from so small an organ,
it could appear so voluminous. Now the curious point is
this&mdash;that no sooner had I learned by the eye its objective
space-significance, than I found myself enabled mentally to
<i>feel</i> it as a movement upwards of a body in the situation of
the uvula. When I now have it, my fancy <i>injects</i> it, so to
speak, with the image of the rising uvula; and it <i>absorbs</i>
the image easily and naturally. In a word, a muscular
contraction gave me a sensation whereof I was unable during
forty years to interpret a motor meaning, of which two
glances of the eye made me permanently the master. To my
mind no further proof is needed of the fact that muscular
contraction, merely as such, need not be perceived directly
as so much motion through space.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<p>Take again the contractions of the muscles which make
the eyeball rotate. The feeling of these is supposed by
many writers to play the chief part in our perceptions of
extent. The space seen between two things <i>means</i>, according
to these authors, nothing but the amount of contraction
which is needed to carry the <i>fovea</i> from the first thing to the
second. But close the eyes and note the contractions in
themselves (even when coupled as they still are with the
delicate surface sensations of the eyeball rolling under the
lids), and we are surprised at finding how vague their space-import
appears. Shut the eyes and roll them, and you can
with no approach to accuracy tell the outer object which
shall first be seen when you open them again.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Moreover, if
our eye-muscle-contractions had much to do with giving us
our sense of seen extent, we ought to have a natural illusion
of which we find no trace. Since the feeling in the muscles
grows disproportionately intense as the eyeball is rolled
into an extreme eccentric position, all places on the extreme
<i>margin</i> of the field of view ought to appear farther from
the centre than they really are, for the fovea cannot get to
them without an amount of this feeling altogether in excess
of the amount of actual rotation.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> When we turn to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
muscles of the body at large we find the same vagueness.
Goldscheider found that the minimal perceived rotation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
a limb about a joint was no less when the movement was
'active' or produced by muscular contraction than when it
was 'passively' impressed.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The consciousness of active
movement became so blunt when the joint (alone!) was
made anæsthetic by faradization, that it became evident
that the feeling of contraction could never be used for
<i>fine</i> discrimination of extents. And that it was not used
for coarse discriminations appeared clear to Goldscheider
from certain other results which are too circumstantial
for me to quote in detail.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> His general conclusion is that
we feel our movements exclusively in our articular surfaces,
and that our muscular contractions in all probability
hardly occasion this sort of perception at all.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>My conclusion is that the 'muscular sense' must fall
back to the humble position from which Charles Bell raised
it, and no longer figure in Psychology as the leading organ
in space-perception which it has been so long 'cracked up'
to be.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before making a minuter study of Space as apprehended
by the eye, we must turn to see what we can discover of
space as known to the blind. But as we do so, let us cast
a glance upon the results of the last pages, and ask ourselves
once more whether the building up of orderly
space-perceptions out of primitive incoherency requires
any mental powers beyond those displayed in ordinary intellectual
operations. I think it is obvious&mdash;granting the
spacial <i>quale</i> to exist in the primitive sensations&mdash;that discrimination,
association, addition, multiplication, and division,
blending into generic images, substitution of similars,
selective emphasis, and abstraction from uninteresting details,
are quite capable of giving us all the space-perceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
we have so far studied, without the aid of any mysterious
'mental chemistry' or power of 'synthesis' to create
elements absent from the original data of feeling. It cannot
be too strongly urged in the face of mystical attempts,
however learned, that there is not a landmark, not a length,
not a point of the compass in real space which <i>is</i> not some
<i>one</i> of our feelings, either experienced directly as a presentation
or ideally suggested by another feeling which has
come to serve as its sign. In degrading some sensations
to the rank of signs and exalting others to that of realities
signified, we smooth out the wrinkles of our first chaotic
impressions and make a continuous order of what was a
rather incoherent multiplicity. But the <i>content</i> of the order
remains identical with that of the multiplicity&mdash;sensational
both, through and through.</p>


<h4>HOW THE BLIND PERCEIVE SPACE.</h4>


<p>The blind man's construction of real space differs from
that of the seeing man most obviously in the larger part
which synthesis plays in it, and the relative subordination
of analysis. The seeing baby's eyes take in the whole
room at once, and discriminative attention must arise in
him before single objects are visually discerned. The blind
child, on the contrary, must form his mental image of the
room by the addition, piece to piece, of parts which he
learns to know successively. With our eyes we may apprehend
instantly, in an enormous bird's-eye view, a landscape
which the blind man is condemned to build up bit
by bit after weeks perhaps of exploration. We are exactly
in his predicament, however, for spaces which exceed our
visual range. We think the ocean as a whole by multiplying
mentally the impression we get at any moment when at
sea. The distance between New York and San Francisco
is computed in days' journeys; that from earth to sun is so
many times the earth's diameter, etc.; and of longer distances
still we may be said to have no adequate mental
image whatever, but only numerical verbal symbols.</p>

<p>But the symbol will often give us the emotional effect
of the perception. Such expressions as the abysmal vault
of heaven, the endless expanse of ocean, etc., summarize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
many computations to the imagination, and give the sense
of an enormous horizon. So it seems with the blind. They
multiply mentally the amount of a distinctly felt freedom
to move, and gain the immediate sense of a vaster freedom
still. Thus it is that blind men are never without the consciousness
of their horizon. They all enjoy travelling, especially
with a companion who can describe to them the
objects they pass. On the prairies they feel the great openness;
in valleys they feel closed in; and one has told me
that he thought few seeing people could enjoy the view
from a mountain-top more than he. A blind person on
entering a house or room immediately receives, from the
reverberations of his voice and steps, an impression of its
dimensions, and to a certain extent of its arrangement.
The tympanic sense noticed on <a href="#Page_140">p. 140</a>, <i>supra</i>, comes in to
help here, and possibly other forms of tactile sensibility not
yet understood. Mr. W. Hanks Levy, the blind author of
'Blindness and the Blind' (London), gives the following account
of his powers of perception:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whether within a house or in the open air, whether walking or
standing still, I can tell, although quite blind, when I am opposite an
object, and can perceive whether it be tall or short, slender or bulky.
I can also detect whether it be a solitary object or a continuous fence;
whether it be a close fence or composed of open rails; and often whether
it be a wooden fence, a brick or stone wall, or a quick-set hedge. I
cannot usually perceive objects if much lower than my shoulder, but
sometimes very low objects can be detected. This may depend on the
nature of the objects, or on some abnormal state of the atmosphere.
The currents of air can have nothing to do with this power, as the state
of the wind does not directly affect it; the sense of hearing has nothing
to do with it, as when snow lies thickly on the ground objects are more
distinct, although the footfall cannot be heard. I seem to perceive
objects through the skin of my face, and to have the impressions immediately
transmitted to the brain. The only part of my body possessing
this power is my face; this I have ascertained by suitable experiments.
Stopping my ears does not interfere with it, but covering my
face with a thick veil destroys it altogether. None of the five senses
have anything to do with the existence of this power, and the circumstances
above named induce me to call this unrecognized sense by the
name of 'facial perception.'... When passing along a street I can
distinguish shops from private houses, and even point out the doors and
windows, etc., and this whether the doors be shut or open. When a
window consists of one entire sheet of glass, it is more difficult to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
than one composed of a number of small panes. From this it
would appear that glass is a bad conductor of sensation, or at any rate
of the sensation specially connected with this sense. When objects
below the face are perceived, the sensation seems to come in an oblique
line from the object to the upper part of the face. While walking with
a friend in Forest Lane, Stratford, I said, pointing to a fence which
separated the road from a field, 'Those rails are not quite as high as
my shoulder.' He looked at them, and said they were higher. We,
however, measured, and found them about three inches lower than my
shoulder. At the time of making this observation I was about four
feet from the rails. Certainly in this instance facial perception was
more accurate than sight. When the lower part of a fence is brickwork,
and the upper part rails, the fact can be detected, and the line
where the two meet easily perceived. Irregularities in height, and projections
and indentations in walls, can also be discovered."</p></blockquote>

<p>According to Mr. Levy, this power of seeing with the
face is diminished by a fog, but not by ordinary darkness.
At one time he could tell when a cloud obscured the
horizon, but he has now lost that power, which he has
known several persons to possess who are totally blind.
These effects of aqueous vapor suggest immediately that
fluctuations in the heat radiated by the objects may be the
source of the perception. One blind gentleman, Mr. Kilburne,
an instructor in the Perkins Institution in South
Boston, who has the power spoken of in an unusual degree,
proved, however, to have no more delicate a sense of temperature
in his face than ordinary persons. He himself
supposed that his ears had nothing to do with the faculty
until a complete stoppage of them, not only with cotton
but with putty on top of it, by abolishing the perception
entirely, proved his first impression to be erroneous. Many
blind men say immediately that their ears are concerned
in the matter.</p>

<p>Sounds certainly play a far more prominent part in
the mental life of the blind than in our own. In taking a
walk through the country, the mutations of sound, far and
near, constitute their chief delight. And to a great extent
their imagination of distance and of objects moving from
one distant spot to another seems to consist in thinking
how a certain sonority would be modified by the change
of place. It is unquestionable that the semi-circular-canal
feelings play a great part in defining the points of the compass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and the direction of distant spots, in the blind as in
us. We <i>start</i> towards them by feelings of this sort; and so
many directions, so many different-feeling starts.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>The only point that offers any theoretic difficulty is the
prolongation into space of the direction, after the start. We
saw, ten pages back, that for extradition to occur beyond the
skin, the portion of skin in question <i>and</i> the space beyond
must form a common object for some other sensory surface.
The eyes are for most of us this sensory surface; for the
blind it can only be other parts of the skin, coupled or not
with motion. But the mere gropings of the hands in every
direction must end by surrounding the whole body with a
sphere of felt space. And this sphere must become enlarged
with every movement of locomotion, these movements
gaining their space-values from the semi-circular-canal
feelings which accompany them, and from the farther
and farther parts of large fixed objects (such as the bed,
the wainscoting, or a fence) which they bring within the
grasp. It might be supposed that a knowledge of space
acquired by so many successive discrete acts would always
retain a somewhat jointed and so to speak, granulated character.
When we who are gifted with sight think of a space
too large to come into a single field of view, we are apt to
imagine it as composite, and filled with more or less jerky
stoppings and startings (think, for instance, of the space
from here to San Francisco), or else we reduce the scale
symbolically and imagine how much larger on a map the
distance would look than others with whose totality we are
familiar.</p>

<p>I am disposed to believe, after interrogating many blind
persons, that the use of imaginary maps on a reduced scale
is less frequent with them than with the rest of us. Possibly
the extraordinary changeableness of the visual magnitudes
of things makes this habit natural to us, while the
fixity of tactile magnitudes keeps them from falling into it.
(When the blind young man operated on by Dr. Franz was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
shown a portrait in a locket, he was vastly surprised that
the face could be put into so small a compass: it would
have seemed to him, he said, as impossible as to put a bushel
into a pint.) Be this as it may, however, the space which
each blind man feels to extend beyond his body is felt by
him as one smooth continuum&mdash;all trace of those muscular
startings and stoppings and reversals which presided over
its formation having been eliminated from the memory. It
seems, in other words, a generic image of the space-element
common to all these experiences, with the unessential particularities
of each left out. In truth, <i>where</i> in this space
a start or a stop may have occurred was quite accidental.
It may never occur just there again, and so the attention
lets it drops altogether. Even as long a space as that
traversed in a several-mile walk will not necessarily appear
to a blind man's thought in the guise of a series of locomotor
acts. Only where there is some distinct locomotor difficulty,
such as a step to ascend, a difficult crossing, or a
disappearance of the path, will distinct locomotor images
constitute the idea. Elsewhere the space seems continuous,
and its parts may even all seem coexistent; though, as a
very intelligent blind friend once remarked to me, 'To
think of such distances involves probably more mental
wear and tear and brain-waste in the blind than in the seeing.'
This seems to point to a greater element of successive
addition and construction in the blind man's idea.</p>

<p>Our own visual explorations go on by means of innumerable
stoppings and startings of the eyeballs. Yet these
are all effaced from the final space-sphere of our visual
imagination. They have neutralized each other. We can
even distribute our attention to the right and left sides
simultaneously, and think of those two quarters of space
as coexistent. Does the smoothing out of the locomotor
interruptions from the blind man's tactile space-sphere
offer any greater paradox? Surely not. And it is curious
to note that both in him and in us there is one particular
locomotor feeling that is apt to assert itself obstinately to
the last. We and he alike spontaneously imagine space as
lying <i>in front</i> of us, for reasons too obvious to enumerate.
If we think of the space behind us, we, as a rule, have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
<i>turn round</i> mentally, and in doing so the front space vanishes.
But in this, as in the other things of which we have
been talking, individuals differ widely. Some, in imagining
a room, can think of all its six surfaces at once. Others
mentally turn round, or, at least, imagine the room in several
successive and mutually exclusive acts (cf. <a href="#Page_54">p. 54</a>, above).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir William Hamilton, and J. S. Mill after him, have
quoted approvingly an opinion of Platner (an eighteenth-century
philosopher) regarding the space-perceptions of
the blind. Platner says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The attentive observation of a person born blind... has convinced
me that the sense of touch by itself is altogether incompetent to
afford us the representation of extension and space.... In fact, to
those born blind, time serves instead of space. Vicinity and distance
mean in their mouths nothing more than the shorter or longer time ... necessary
to attain from some one feeling to some other."</p></blockquote>

<p>After my own observation of blind people, I should
hardly have considered this as anything but an eccentric
opinion, worthy to pair off with that other belief that color
is primitively seen without extent, had it not been for the
remarkable Essay on Tactile and Visual Space by M. Ch.
Dunan, which appeared in the Revue Philosophique for
1888. This author quotes<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> three very competent witnesses,
all officials in institutions for the blind [it does not appear
from the text that more than one of them was blind himself],
who say that blind people <i>only live in time</i>. M.
Dunan himself does not share exactly this belief, but he
insists that the blind man's and the seeing man's representation
of space have <i>absolutely naught</i> in common, and that
we are deceived into believing that what they mean by
space is analogous to what we mean, by the fact that so many
of them are but semi-blind and still think in visual terms,
and from the farther fact that they all <i>talk</i> in visual terms
just like ourselves. But on examining M. Dunan's reasons
one finds that they all rest on the groundless logical assumption
that the perception of a geometrical form which
we get with our eyes, and that which a blind man gets with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
his fingers, must either be absolutely identical or absolutely
unlike. They cannot be similar in diversity, "for they are
simple notions, and it is of the essence of such to enter the
mind or leave it all at once, so that one who has a simple notion
at all, possesses it in all its completeness.... Therefore,
since it is impossible that the blind should have of
the forms in question ideas <i>completely identical</i> with our seeing
ones, it follows that their ideas must be <i>radically different
from and wholly irreducible to our own</i>."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Hereupon
M. Dunan has no difficulty in finding a blind man who still
preserves a crude sensation of diffused light, and who says
when questioned that <i>this light has no extent</i>. Having 'no
extent' appears, however, on farther questioning, to signify
merely not enveloping any particular tactile objects, nor
being located within their outline; so that (allowing for
latitude of expression) the result tallies perfectly with our
own view. A relatively stagnant retinal sensation of diffused
light, not varying when different objects are handled, would
naturally remain an object quite apart. If the word 'extent'
were habitually used to denote tactile extent, this sensation,
having no tactile associates whatever, would naturally
have 'extent' denied of it. And yet all the while it
would be <i>analogous</i> to the tactile sensations in having the
quality of bigness. Of course it would have no <i>other</i> tactile
qualities, just as the tactile objects have no other optical
qualities than bigness. All sorts of analogies obtain
between the spheres of sensibility. Why are 'sweet' and
'soft' used so synonymously in most languages? and why
are both these adjectives applied to objects of so many
sensible kinds? Rough sounds, heavy smells, hard lights,
cold colors, are other examples. Nor does it follow from
such analogies as these that the sensations compared need
be composite and have some of their parts identical. We
saw in Chapter XIII that likeness and difference are an elementary
relation, not to be resolved in every case into a
mixture of absolute identity and absolute heterogeneity of
content (cf. Vol. I, pp. 492-3).</p>

<p>I conclude, then, that although in its more superficial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
determinations the blind man's space is very different from
our space, yet a deep analogy remains between the two.
'Big' and 'little,' 'far' and 'near,' are similar contents of consciousness
in both of us. But the <i>measure</i> of the bigness and
the farness is very different in him and in ourselves. He, for
example, can have no notion of what we mean by objects
appearing smaller as they move away, because he must
always conceive of them as of their constant tactile size.
Nor, whatever analogy the two extensions involve, should
we expect that a blind man receiving sight for the first
time should recognize his new-given optical objects by their
familiar tactile names. Molyneux wrote to Locke:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch
to distinguish between a cube and a sphere,... so as to tell, when he
felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose
then the cube and sphere placed on a table and the blind man to be
made to see; query, whether by his sight, before he touched them, he
could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?"</p></blockquote>

<p>This has remained in literature as 'Molyneux's query.'
Molyneux answered 'No.' And Locke says:<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I agree with this thinking gentleman whom I am proud to call my
friend, and am of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be
able to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw
them; though he could unerringly name them by his touch and
certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt."</p></blockquote>

<p>This opinion has not lacked experimental confirmation.
From Chesselden's case downwards, patients operated for
congenital cataract have been unable to name at first the
things they saw. "So, Puss, I shall know you another time,"
said Chesselden's patient, after catching the cat, looking at
her steadfastly, and setting her down. Some of this incapacity
is unquestionably due to general mental confusion at
the new experience, and to the excessively unfavorable conditions
for perception which an eye with its lens just extirpated
affords. That the analogy of inner nature between
the retinal and tactile sensations goes beyond mere extensity
is proved by the cases where the patients were the most
intelligent, as in the young man operated on by Dr. Franz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
who named circular, triangular, and quadrangular figures
at first sight.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>


<h4>VISUAL SPACE.</h4>


<p>It is when we come to analyze minutely the conditions
of <i>visual</i> perception that difficulties arise which have made
psychologists appeal to new and <i>quasi</i>-mythical mental
powers. But I firmly believe that even here exact investigation
will yield the same verdict as in the cases studied
hitherto. This subject will close our survey of the facts;
and if it give the result I foretell, we shall be in the best of
positions for a few final pages of critically historical review.</p>

<p>If a common person is asked how he is enabled to see
things as they are, he will simply reply, by opening his
eyes and looking. This innocent answer has, however,
long since been impossible for science. There are various
paradoxes and irregularities about <i>what</i> we appear to perceive
under seemingly identical optical conditions, which
immediately raise questions. To say nothing now of the
time-honored conundrums of why we see upright with an
inverted retinal picture, and why we do not see double;
and to leave aside the whole field of color-contrasts and
ambiguities, as not directly relevant to the space-problem,&mdash;it
is certain that the same retinal image makes us see quite
differently-sized and differently-shaped objects at different
times, and it is equally certain that the same ocular movement
varies in its perceptive import. It ought to be possible,
were the act of perception completely and <i>simply</i>
intelligible, to assign for every distinct judgment of size,
shape, and position a distinct optical modification of some
kind as its occasion. And the connection between the two
ought to be so constant that, given the same modification,
we should always have the same judgment. But if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
study the facts closely <i>we soon find no such constant connection
between either judgment and retinal modification, or
judgment and muscular modification, to exist.</i> The judgment
seems to result from the combination of retinal, muscular
and intellectual factors with each other; and any one of
them may occasionally overpower the rest in a way which
seems to leave the matter subject to no simple law.</p>

<p>The scientific study of the subject, if we omit Descartes,
began with Berkeley, and the particular perception he
analyzed in his New Theory of Vision was that of distance
or depth. Starting with the physical assumption that a
difference in the distance of a point can make no difference
in the nature of its retinal image, since "distance being a
line directed endwise to the eye, it projects only one point
in the fund of the eye&mdash;which point remains invariably the
same, whether the distance be longer or shorter," he concluded
that distance could not possibly be a visual sensation,
but must be an intellectual 'suggestion' from 'custom'
of some non-visual experience. According to Berkeley this
experience was tactile. His whole treatment of the subject
was excessively vague,&mdash;no shame to him, as a breaker of
fresh ground,&mdash;but as it has been adopted and enthusiastically
hugged in all its vagueness by nearly the whole line of
British psychologists who have succeeded him, it will be
well for us to begin our study of vision by refuting his
notion that depth cannot possibly be perceived in terms of
purely visual feeling.</p>


<h4><i>The Third Dimension.</i></h4>


<p>Berkeleyans unanimously assume that no retinal sensation
can primitively be of volume; if it be of extension at
all (which they are barely disposed to admit), it can be only
of two-, not of three-, dimensional extension. At the beginning
of the present chapter we denied this, and adduced
facts to show that all objects of sensation are voluminous
in three dimensions (cf. <a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a> ff.). It is impossible to lie
on one's back on a hill, to let the empty abyss of blue fill
one's whole visual field, and to sink deeper and deeper into
the merely sensational mode of consciousness regarding it,
without feeling that an indeterminate, palpitating, circling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
depth is as indefeasibly one of its attributes as its breadth.
We may artificially exaggerate this sensation of depth.
Rise and look from the hill-top at the distant view; represent
to yourself as vividly as possible the distance of the
uttermost horizon; and then <i>with inverted head</i> look at the
same. There will be a startling increase in the perspective,
a most sensible recession of the maximum distance; and
as you raise the head you can actually see the horizon-line
again draw near.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Mind, I say nothing as yet about our estimate of the
'real' amount of this depth or distance. I only want to
confirm its existence as a natural and inevitable optical
consort of the two other optical dimensions. The field of
view is always a <i>volume-unit</i>. Whatever be supposed to be
its absolute and 'real' size, the relative sizes of its dimensions
are functions of each other. Indeed, it happens perhaps
most often that the breadth- and height-feeling take
their absolute measure from the depth-feeling. If we plunge
our head into a wash-basin, the felt nearness of the bottom
makes us feel the lateral expanse to be small. If, on the
contrary, we are on a mountain-top, the distance of the
horizon carries with it in our judgment a proportionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
height and length in the mountain-chains that bound it to
our view. But as aforesaid, let us not consider the question
of absolute size now,&mdash;it must later be taken up in a
thorough way. Let us confine ourselves to the way in
which the three dimensions which are seen, get their values
fixed <i>relatively to each other</i>.</p>

<p>Reid, in his Inquiry into the Human Mind, has a section
'Of the Geometry of Visibles,' in which he assumes to
trace what the perceptions would be of a race of 'Idomenians'
reduced to the sole sense of sight. Agreeing with
Berkeley that sight alone can give no knowledge of the third
dimension, he humorously deduces various ingenious absurdities
in their interpretations of the material appearances
before their eyes.</p>

<p>Now I firmly believe, on the contrary, that one of Reid's
Idomenians would frame precisely the same conception of
the external world that we do, if he had our intellectual
powers.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Even were his very eyeballs fixed and not movable
like ours, that would only retard, not frustrate, his
education. For the <i>same object</i>, by alternately covering in
its lateral movements different parts of his retina, would
determine the mutual equivalencies of the first two dimensions
of the field of view; and by exciting the physiological
cause of his perception of depth in various degrees, it would
establish a scale of equivalency between the first two and
the third.</p>

<p>First of all, one of the sensations given by the object
is chosen to represent its 'real' size and shape, in accordance
with the principles laid down on <a href="#Page_178">pp. 178</a> and <a href="#Page_179">179</a>.
<i>One sensation measures the 'thing' present, and the 'thing' then
measures the other sensations.</i> The peripheral parts of the
retina are equated with the central by receiving the image
of the same object. This needs no elucidation in case the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
object does not change its distance or its front. But suppose,
to take a more complicated case, that the object is a
stick, seen first in its whole length, and then rotated round
one of its ends; let this fixed end be the one near the eye.
In this movement the stick's image will grow progressively
shorter; its farther end will appear less and less separated
laterally from its fixed near end; soon it will be
screened by the latter, and then reappear on the opposite
side, and finally on that side resume its original length.
Suppose this movement to become a familiar experience;
the mind will presumably react upon it after its usual fashion
(which is that of unifying all data which it is in any
way possible to unify), and consider it the movement of a
constant object rather than the transformation of a fluctuating
one. Now, the <i>sensation of depth</i> which it receives during
the experience is awakened more by the far than by the
near end of the object. But how much depth? What shall
measure its amount? Why, at the moment the far end is
ready to be eclipsed, the difference of its distance from the
near end's distance must be judged equal to the stick's
whole length; but that length has already been judged
equal to a certain optical sensation of breadth. <i>Thus we
find that given amounts of the visual depth-feeling become signs
of fixed amounts of the visual breadth-feeling. The measurement
of distance is, as Berkeley truly said, a result of suggestion
and experience. But visual experience alone is adequate
to produce it, and this he erroneously denied.</i></p>

<p>Suppose a colonel in front of his regiment at dress-parade,
and suppose he walks at right angles towards the
midmost man of the line. As he advances, and surveys
the line in either direction, he looks more and more <i>down</i>
it and less and less <i>at</i> it, until, when abreast of the midmost
man, he feels the end men to be <i>most</i> distant; then
when the line casts hardly any lateral image on his retina
at all, what distance shall he judge to be that of the end
men? Why, half the length of the regiment as it was
originally seen, of course; but this length was a moment
ago a retinal object spread out laterally before his sight.
He has now merely equated a retinal depth-feeling with a
retinal breadth-feeling. If the regiment moved, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
colonel stood still, the result would be the same. In such
ways as these a creature endowed with eyes alone could
hardly fail of measuring out all three dimensions of the
space he inhabited. And we ourselves, I think, although
we <i>may</i> often 'realize' distance in locomotor terms
(as Berkeley says we must always do), yet do so no less
often in terms of our retinal map, and always in this way
the more spontaneously. Were this not so, the three visual
dimensions could not possibly feel to us as homogeneous as
they do, nor as commensurable <i>inter se</i>.</p>

<p><i>Let us then admit distance to be at least as genuinely optical
a content of consciousness as either height or breadth. The
question immediately returns, Can any of them be said in any
strictness to be optical sensations?</i> We have contended all
along for the affirmative reply to this question, but must
now cope with difficulties greater than any that have assailed
us hitherto.</p>


<h4><i>Helmholtz and Reid on Sensations</i>.</h4>


<p>A sensation is, as we have seen in <a href="#PSYCHOLOGY">Chapter XVII</a>,
the mental affection that follows most immediately upon
the stimulation of the sense-tract. Its antecedent is directly
physical, no psychic links, no acts of memory, inference,
or association intervening. Accordingly, if we suppose
the nexus between neural process in the sense-organ,
on the one hand, and conscious affection, on the other, to
be by nature uniform, <i>the same process ought always to give
the same sensation;</i> and conversely, <i>if what seems to be a sensation
varies whilst the process in the sense-organ remains unchanged,
the reason is presumably that it is really not a sensation
but a higher mental product, whereof the variations depend
on events occurring in the system of higher cerebral centres.</i></p>

<p>Now the <i>size</i> of the field of view varies enormously in all
three dimensions, without our being able to assign with any
definiteness the process in the visual tract on which the
variation depends. We just saw how impossible such
assignment was in the case where turning down the head
produces the enlargement. In general, the maximum feeling
of depth or distance seems to take the lead in determining
the apparent magnitude of the whole field, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
two other dimensions seem to follow. If, to use the former
instance, I look close into a wash-basin, the lateral extent
of the field shrinks proportionately to its nearness. If I
look from a mountain, the things seen are vast in height
and breadth, in proportion to the farness of the horizon.
But <i>when we ask what changes in the eye determine how great
this maximum feeling of depth or distance</i> (which is undoubtedly
felt as a unitary vastness) <i>shall be, we find ourselves
unable to point to any one of them as being its absolutely regular
concomitant.</i> Convergence, accommodation, double and
disparate images, differences in the parallactic displacement
when we move our head, faintness of tint, dimness of outline,
and smallness of the retinal image of objects named
and known, are all processes that have <i>something to do</i> with
the perception of 'far' and of 'near'; but the effect of
each and any one of them in determining such a perception
at one moment may at another moment be reversed by the
presence of some other sensible quality in the object, that
makes us, evidently by reminding us of past experience,
judge it to be at a different distance and of another shape.
If we paint the inside of a pasteboard-mask like the outside,
and look at it with one eye, the accommodation- and
parallax-feelings are there, but fail to make us see it hollow,
as it is. Our mental knowledge of the fact that human
faces are always convex overpowers them, and we directly
perceive the nose to be nearer to us than the cheek instead
of farther of.</p>

<p>The other organic tokens of farness and nearness are
proved by similar experiments (of which we shall ere long
speak more in detail) to have an equally fluctuating import.
They lose all their value whenever the collateral circumstances
favor a strong intellectual conviction that the object
presented to the gaze is <i>improbable</i>&mdash;cannot be either <i>what</i>
or <i>where</i> they would make us perceive it to be.</p>

<p>Now the query immediately arises: <i>Can the feelings of
these processes in the eye, since they are so easily neutralized and
reversed by intellectual suggestions, ever have been direct sensations
of distance at all</i>? Ought we not rather to assume,
since the distances which we see <i>in spite</i> of them are conclusions
from past experience, that the distances which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
see <i>by means</i> of them are equally such conclusions? Ought
we not, in short, to say unhesitatingly that distance must be
an intellectual and not a sensible content of consciousness?
and that each of these eye-feelings serves as a mere signal
to awaken this content, our intellect being so framed that
sometimes it notices one signal more readily and sometimes
another?</p>

<p>Reid long ago (Inquiry, c. vi. sec. 17) said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It may be taken for a general rule that things which are produced
by custom may be undone or changed by disuse or by contrary custom.
On the other hand, it is a strong argument that an effect is not owing
to custom, but to the constitution of nature, when a contrary custom is
found neither to change nor to weaken it."</p></blockquote>

<p>More briefly, a way of seeing things that can be unlearned
was presumably learned, and only what we cannot
unlearn is instinctive.</p>

<p>This seems to be Helmholtz's view, for he confirms
Reid's maxim by saying in emphatic print:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No elements in our perception can be sensational which may be
overcome or reversed by factors of demonstrably experimental origin.
Whatever can be overcome by suggestions of experience must be regarded
as itself a product of experience and custom. If we follow this
rule it will appear that only <i>qualities</i> are sensational, whilst almost all
<i>spatial</i> attributes are results of habit and experience."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This passage of Helmholtz's has obtained, it seems to
me, an almost deplorable celebrity. The reader will please
observe its very radical import. Not only would he, and
does he, for the reasons we have just been ourselves considering,
deny distance to be an optical sensation; but,
extending the same method of criticism to judgments of
size, shape, and direction, and finding no single retinal or
muscular process in the eyes to be indissolubly linked with
any one of these, he goes so far as to say that all optical
space-perceptions whatsoever must have an intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
origin, and a content that no items of visual sensibility can
account for.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>As Wundt and others agree with Helmholtz here, and
as their conclusions, if true, are irreconcilable with all the
sensationalism which I have been teaching hitherto, it
clearly devolves upon me to defend my position against this
new attack. But as this chapter on Space is already so
overgrown with episodes and details, I think it best to
reserve the refutation of their general principle for the next
chapter, and simply to assume at this point its untenability.
This has of course an arrogant look; but if the reader will
bear with me for not very many pages more, I shall hope to
appease his mind. Meanwhile I affirm confidently that
<i>the same outer objects actually</i> <span class="smcap">feel</span> <i>different to us according as
our brain reacts on them in one way or another by making us
perceive them as this or as that sort of thing.</i> So true is this
that one may well, with Stumpf,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> reverse Helmholtz's query,
and ask: "What would become of our sense-perceptions
in case experience were <i>not</i> able so to transform them?"
Stumpf adds: "All wrong perceptions that depend on
peculiarities in the organs are more or less perfectly corrected
by the influence of imagination following the guidance
of experience."</p>

<p>If, therefore, among the facts of optical space-perception
(which we must now proceed to consider in more detail) we
find instances of an identical organic eye-process, giving us
different perceptions at different times, in consequence of
different collateral circumstances suggesting different objective
facts to our imagination, we must not hastily conclude,
with the school of Helmholtz and Wundt, that the organic
eye-process pure and simple, without the collateral circumstances,
is incapable of giving us any sensation of a spatial
kind at all. We must rather seek to discover <i>by what means</i>
the circumstances can so have transformed a space-sensation,
which, but for their presence, would probably have
been felt in its natural purity. And I may as well say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
now in advance that we shall find the means to be nothing
more or less than association&mdash;<i>the suggestion to the mind of
optical objects not actually present,</i> but more habitually associated
with the 'collateral circumstances' than the sensation
which they now displace and being imagined now with
a quasi-hallucinatory strength. But before this conclusion
emerges, it will be necessary to have reviewed the
most important facts of optical space-perception, in relation
to the organic conditions on which they depend. Readers
acquainted with German optics will excuse what is already
familiar to them in the following section.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<p>Let us begin the long and rather tedious inquiry by the
most important case. Physiologists have long sought for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
a simple law by which to connect the seen direction and
distance of objects with the retinal impressions they produce.
Two principal theories have been held of this matter,
the 'theory of identical points,' and the 'theory of projection,'&mdash;each
incompatible with the other, and each
beyond certain limits becoming inconsistent with the
facts.</p>


<h4><i>The Theory of Identical Points</i>.</h4>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/fig_54.jpg" width="500" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 54.</div>
</div>

<p>This theory starts from the truth that on both retinæ
an impression on the upper half makes us perceive an object
as below, on the lower half as above, the horizon; and
on the right half an object to the left, on the left half one
to the right, of the median line. Thus each quadrant of one
retina corresponds as a whole to the <i>similar</i> quadrant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the other; and within two similar quadrants, <i>al</i> and <i>ar</i> for
example, there should, if the correspondence were consistently
carried out, be geometrically similar points which, if
impressed at the same time by light emitted from the same
object, should cause that object to appear in the same direction
to either eye. Experiment verifies this surmise. If
we look at the starry vault with parallel eyes, the stars all
seem single; and the laws of perspective show that under
the circumstances the parallel light-rays coming from each
star must impinge on points within either retina which <i>are</i>
geometrically similar to each other. The same result may
be more artificially obtained. If we take two exactly similar
pictures, smaller, or at least no larger, than those on an
ordinary stereoscopic slide, and if we look at them as
stereoscopic slides are looked at, that is, at one with each
eye (a median partition confining the view of either eye to
the picture opposite it), we shall see but one flat picture,
all of whose parts appear sharp and single.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Identical
points being impressed, both eyes see their object in the
same direction, and the two objects consequently coalesce
into one.</p>

<p>The same thing may be shown in still another way.
With fixed head converge the eyes upon some conspicuous
objective point behind a pane of glass; then close either
eye alternately and make a little ink-mark on the glass,
'covering' the object as seen by the eye which is momentarily
open. On looking now with both eyes the ink-marks
will seem single, and in the same direction as the objective
point. Conversely, let the eyes converge on a single ink-spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
on the glass, and then by alternate shutting of them
let it be noted what objects behind the glass the spot
covers to the right and left eye respectively. Now with
both eyes open, both these objects and the spot will
appear in the same place, one or other of the three becoming
more distinct according to the fluctuations of retinal
attention.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Now what is the direction of this common place? The
only way of defining the direction of an object is by <i>pointing
to it</i>. Most people, if asked to look at an object over
the horizontal edge of a sheet of paper which conceals their
hand and arm, and then to point their finger at it (raising
the hand gradually so that at last a finger-tip will appear
above the sheet of paper), are found to place the finger not
between either eye and the object, but between the latter
and the root of the nose, and this whether both eyes or
either alone be used. Hering and Helmholtz express this
by saying that we judge of the direction of objects as they
would appear to an imaginary cyclopean eye, situated between
our two real eyes, and with its optical axis bisecting
the angle of convergence of the latter. Our two retinæ act,
according to Hering, as if they were superposed in the
place of this imaginary double-eye; we see by the corresponding
points of each, situated far asunder as they really
are, just as we <i>should</i> see if they were superposed and could
both be excited together.</p>

<p>The judgment of objective singleness and that of identical
direction seem to hang necessarily together. And that
of identical direction seems to carry with it the necessity of
a common origin, between the eyes or elsewhere, from which
all the directions felt may seem to be estimated. This is
why the cyclopean eye is really a fundamental part of the
formulation of the theory of identical retinal points, and
why Hering, the greatest champion of this theory, lays so
much stress upon it.</p>

<p><i>It is an immediate consequence of the law of identical</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
<i>projection of images on geometrically similar points that images
which fall upon geometrically</i> <span class="smcap">disparate</span> <i>points of the two retinæ
should be projected in</i> <span class="smcap">disparate</span> <i>directions, and that their objects
should consequently appear in</i> <span class="smcap">two</span> <i>places, or</i> <span class="smcap">look double</span>.
Take the parallel rays from a star falling upon two eyes
which converge upon a near object, O, instead of being
parallel, as in the previously instanced case. If SL and SR
in Fig. 55 be the parallel rays, each of them will fall upon
the nasal half of the retina which it strikes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_55.jpg" width="400" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 55.</div>
</div>

<p>But the two nasal halves are disparate, geometrically
<i>symmetrical</i>, not geometrically <i>similar</i>. The image on the
left one will therefore appear as if lying in a direction leftward
of the cyclopean eye's line of sight; the image of the
right one will appear far to the right of the same direction.
The star will, in short, be seen double,&mdash;'homonymously'
double.</p>

<p>Conversely, if the star be looked at directly with parallel
axes, O will be seen double, because its images will affect
the outer or cheek halves of the two retinæ, instead of one
outer and one nasal half. The position of the images will
here be reversed from that of the previous case. The right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
eye's image will now appear to the left, the left eye's to the
right&mdash;the double images will be 'heteronymous.'</p>

<p>The same reasoning and the same result ought to apply
where the object's place with respect to the direction of the
two optic axes is such as to make its images fall not on non-similar
retinal halves, but on non-similar parts of similar
halves. Here, of course, the directions of projection will
be less widely disparate than in the other case, and the
double images will appear to lie less widely apart.</p>

<p>Careful experiments made by many observers according
to the so-called haploscopic method confirm this law, and
show that <i>corresponding points, of single visual direction,</i> exist
upon the two retinæ. For the detail of these one must consult
the special treatises.</p>

<p>Note now an important consequence. If we take a
stationary object and allow the eyes to vary their direction
and convergence, a purely geometrical study will show that
there will be some positions in which its two images impress
corresponding retinal points, but more in which they impress
disparate points. The former constitute the so-called
horopter, and their discovery has been attended with great
mathematical difficulty. Objects or parts of objects which
lie in the eyes' horopter at any given time cannot appear
double. <i>Objects lying out of the horopter would seem, if the
theory of identical points were strictly true, necessarily and always
to appear double.</i></p>

<p>Here comes the first great conflict of the identity-theory
with experience. Were the theory true, we ought all to
have an intuitive knowledge of the horopter as the line of
distinctest vision. Objects placed elsewhere ought to seem,
if not actually double, at least blurred. And yet no living
man makes any such distinction between the parts of his
field of vision. To most of us the whole field appears single,
and it is only by rare accident or by special education that
we ever catch a glimpse of a double image. In 1838, Wheatstone,
in his truly classical memoir on binocular vision and
the stereoscope,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> showed that the disparateness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
points on which the two images of an object fall does not
within certain limits affect its seen singleness at all, but
rather the <i>distance</i> at which it shall appear. Wheatstone
made an observation, moreover, which subsequently became
the bone of much hot contention, in which he strove to
show that not only might disparate images fuse, but images
on corresponding or identical points might be seen
double.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>I am unfortunately prevented by the weakness of my
own eyes from experimenting enough to form a decided
personal opinion on the matter. It seems to me, however,
that the balance of evidence is against the Wheatstonian
interpretation, and that disparate points may fuse, without
identical points for that reason ever giving double images.
The two questions, "Can we see single with disparate
points?" and "Can we see double with identical points?"
although at the first blush they may appear, as to Helmholtz
they appear, to be but two modes of expressing the
same inquiry, are in reality distinct. The first may quite
well be answered affirmatively and the second negatively.</p>

<p>Add to this that the experiment quoted from Helmholtz
above by no means always succeeds, but that many individuals
place their finger between the object and <i>one</i> of
their eyes, oftenest the right;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> finally, observe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
identity-theory, with its Cyclopean starting point for all
lines of direction, gives by itself no ground for the <i>distance</i>
on any line at which an object shall appear, and has to be
helped out in this respect by subsidiary hypotheses, which,
in the hands of Hering and others, have become so complex
as easily to fall a prey to critical attacks; and it will soon
seem as if <i>the law of identical seen directions by corresponding
points, although a simple formula for expressing concisely many
fundamental phenomena, is by no means an adequate account of
the whole matter of retinal perception.</i><a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>


<h4><i>The Projection-Theory</i>.</h4>


<p>Does the theory of projection fare any better? This
theory admits that each eye sees the object in a different
direction from the other, along the line, namely, passing
from the object through the middle of the pupil to the
retina. A point directly fixated is thus seen on the optical
axes of both eyes. There is only one point, however,
which these two optical axes have in common, and that is
the point to which they converge. Everything directly
looked at is seen at this point, and is thus seen both single
and at its proper distance. It is easy to show the incompatibility
of this theory with the theory of identity. Take
an objective point (like O in Fig. 50, when the star is looked
at) casting its images R' and L' on geometrically dissimilar
parts of the two retinæ and affecting the outer half of each
eye. On the identity-theory it ought necessarily to appear
double, whilst on the projection-theory there is no reason
whatever why it should not appear single, provided only
it be located by the judgment on each line of visible direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
neither nearer nor farther than its point of intersection
with the other line.</p>

<p><i>Every point in the field of view ought, in truth, if the projection-theory
were uniformly valid, to appear single,</i> entirely
irrespective of the varying positions of the eyes, for from
every point of space two lines of visible direction pass to
the two retinæ; and at the intersection of these lines, or
just where the point is, there, according to the theory, it
should appear. <i>The objection to this theory is thus precisely
the reverse of the objection to the identity-theory. If the latter
ruled, we ought to see most things double all the time. If the
projection-theory ruled, we ought never to see anything double.
As a matter of fact we get too few double images for the identity-theory,
and too many for the projection-theory.</i></p>

<p>The partisans of the projection-theory, beginning with
Aguilonius, have always explained double images as the
result of an erroneous judgment of the <i>distance</i> of the object,
the images of the latter being projected by the imagination
along the two lines of visible direction either nearer or
farther than the point of intersection of the latter. A
diagram will make this clear.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/fig_56.jpg" width="300" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 56.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Let O be the point looked at, M an object farther, and
N an object nearer, than it. Then M and N will send the
lines of visible direction MM and NN to the two retinæ.
If N be judged as far as O, it must necessarily lie where
the two lines of visible direction NN intersect the plane of
the arrow, or in two places, at N' and at N''. If M be
judged as near as O, it must for the same reason form two
images at M' and M''.</p>

<p>It is, as a matter of fact, true that we often misjudge
the distance in the way alleged. If the reader will hold his
forefingers, one beyond the other, in the median line, and
fixate them alternately, he will see the one not looked at,
double; and he will also notice that it appears nearer to the
plane of the one looked at, whichever the latter may be,
than it really is. Its changes of apparent size, as the convergence
of the eyes alter, also prove the change of apparent
distance. The distance at which the axes converge
seems, in fact, to exert a sort of attraction upon objects
situated elsewhere. Being the distance of which we are
most acutely sensible, it invades, so to speak, the whole
field of our perception. If two half-dollars be laid on the
table an inch or two apart, and the eyes fixate steadily the
point of a pen held in the median line at varying distances
between the coins and the face, there will come a
distance at which the pen stands between the left half-dollar
and the right eye, and the right half-dollar and the
left eye. The two half-dollars will then coalesce into one;
and this one will show its apparent approach to the pen-point
by seeming suddenly much reduced in size.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Yet, in spite of this tendency to inaccuracy, we are never
actually mistaken about the half-dollar being behind the
pen-point. It may not seem far enough off, but still it is
farther than the point. In general it may be said that
where the objects are known to us, no such illusion of distance
occurs in any one as the theory would require. And
in some observers, Hering for example, it seems hardly to
occur at all. If I look into infinite distance and get my
finger in double images, they do not seem infinitely far off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
To make objects at different distances seem equidistant,
careful precautions must be taken to have them alike in
appearance, and to exclude all outward reasons for ascribing
to the one a different location from that ascribed to the
other. Thus Donders tries to prove the law of projection
by taking two similar electric sparks, one behind the other
on a dark ground, one seen double; or an iron rod placed
so near to the eyes that its double images seem as broad as
that of a fixated stove-pipe, the top and bottom of the objects
being cut off by screens, so as to prevent all suggestions
of perspective, etc. The three objects in each experiment
seem in the same plane.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Add to this the impossibility, recognized by <i>all</i> observers,
of ever seeing double with the <i>fovea</i>, and the fact that
authorities as able as those quoted in the note on Wheatstone's
observation deny that they can see double then with
identical points, and we are forced to conclude that <i>the
projection-theory, like its predecessor, breaks down. Neither
formulates exactly or exhaustively a law for all our perceptions.</i></p>


<h4><i>Ambiguity of Retinal Impressions</i>.</h4>

</div>

<p><i>What does each theory try to do? To make of seen location
a fixed function of retinal impression. Other facts may be
brought forward to show how far from fixed are the perceptive
functions of retinal impressions.</i> We alluded a while ago to
the extraordinary ambiguity of the retinal image as a revealer
of magnitude. Produce an after-image of the sun
and look at your finger-tip: it will be smaller than your
nail. Project it on the table, and it will be as big as a
strawberry; on the wall, as large as a plate; on yonder
mountain, bigger than a house. And yet it is an unchanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
retinal impression. Prepare a sheet with the figures shown
in Fig. 57 strongly marked upon it, and get by direct fixation
a distinct after-image of each.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;">
<img src="images/figs_58_59.jpg" width="445" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 58 &amp; 59.</div>
</div>

<p>Project the after-image of the cross upon the upper left-hand
part of the wall, it will appear as in Fig. 58; on the
upper right-hand it will appear as in Fig. 59. The circle
similarly projected will be distorted into two different
ellipses. If the two parallel lines be projected upon the
ceiling or floor far in front, the farther ends will diverge;
and if the three parallel lines be thrown on the same surfaces,
the upper pair will seem farther apart than the lower.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p>Adding certain lines to others has the same distorting
effect. In what is known as Zöllner's pattern (Fig. 60), the
long parallels tip towards each other the moment we draw
the short slanting lines over them yet their retinal images
are the same they always were. A similar distortion of
parallels appears in Fig 61.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">

<p>Drawing a square inside the circle (Fig. 62) gives to the
outline of the latter an indented appearance where the
square's corners touch it. Drawing the radii inside of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a><br /><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of the right angles in the same figure makes it seem larger
than the other. In Fig. 63, the retinal image of the space
between the extreme dots is in all three lines the same, yet
it seems much larger the moment it is filled up with other
dots.</p>

<p>In the stereoscope certain pairs of lines which look
single under ordinary circumstances immediately seem
double when we add certain other lines to them.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<h4><i>Ambiguous Import of Eye-movements</i>.</h4>


<p>These facts show the indeterminateness of the space-import
of various <i>retinal impressions</i>. Take now the <i>eye's
movements</i>, and we find a similar vacillation. When we
follow a moving object with our gaze, the motion is 'voluntary';
when our eyes oscillate to and fro after we have
made ourselves dizzy by spinning around, it is 'reflex';
and when the eyeball is pushed with the finger, it is 'passive.'
Now, in all three of these cases we get a feeling
from the movement as it effects itself. But the objective
perceptions to which the feeling assists us are by no means
the same. In the first case we may see a stationary field
of view with one moving object in it; in the second, the
total field swimming more or less steadily in one direction;
in the third, a sudden jump or twist of the same total
field.</p>

<p><i>The feelings of convergence</i> of the eyeballs permit of the
same ambiguous interpretation. When objects are near we
converge strongly upon them in order to see them; when
far, we set our optic axes parallel. But the exact degree of
convergence fails to be felt; or rather, being felt, fails to
tell us the absolute distance of the object we are regarding.
Wheatstone arranged his stereoscope in such a way that the
size of the retinal images might change without the convergence
altering; or conversely, the convergence might
change without the retinal image altering. Under these
circumstances, he says,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> the object seemed to approach or
recede in the first case, without altering its size, in the
second, to change its size without altering its distance&mdash;just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the reverse of what might have been expected. Wheatstone
adds, however, that 'fixing the attention' converted each of
these perceptions into its opposite. The same perplexity
occurs in looking through prismatic glasses, which alter the
eyes' convergence. We cannot decide whether the object
has come nearer, or grown larger, or both, or neither; and
our judgment vacillates in the most surprising way. We
may even make our eyes diverge, and the object will none
the less appear at a finite distance. When we look through
the stereoscope, the picture seems at no determinate distance.
These and other facts have led Helmholtz to deny
that the feeling of convergence has any very exact value as
a distance-measurer.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>With <i>the feelings of accommodation</i> it is very much the
same. Donders has shown<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> that the apparent magnifying
power of spectacles of moderate convexity hardly depends at
all upon their enlargement of the retinal image, but rather
on the relaxation they permit of the muscle of accommodation.
This suggests an object farther off, and consequently
a much larger one, since its retinal size rather increases
than diminishes. But in this case the same vacillation of
judgment as in the previously mentioned case of convergence
takes place. The recession made the object seem
larger, but the apparent growth in size of the object now
makes it look as if it came nearer instead of receding. The
effect thus contradicts its own cause. Everyone is conscious,
on first putting on a pair of spectacles, of a doubt whether
the field of view draws near or retreats.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>There is still <i>another deception, occurring in persons who
have had one eye-muscle suddenly paralyzed.</i> This deception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
has led Wundt to affirm that the eyeball-feeling proper, the
incoming sensation of effected rotation, tells us only of the
direction of our eye-movements, but not of their whole extent.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
For this reason, and because not only Wundt, but
many other authors, think the phenomena in these partial
paralyses demonstrate the existence of a feeling of innervation,
a feeling of the outgoing nervous current, opposed to
every afferent sensation whatever, it seems proper to note
the facts with a certain degree of detail.</p>

<p>Suppose a man wakes up some morning with the external
rectus muscle of his right eye half paralyzed, what will
be the result? He will be enabled only with great effort
to rotate the eye so as to look at objects lying far off to the
right. Something in the effort he makes will make him feel
as if the object lay much farther to the right than it really
is. If the left and sound eye be closed, and he be asked
to touch rapidly with his finger an object situated towards
his right, he will point the finger to the right of it. The
current explanation of the 'something' in the effort which
causes this deception is that it is the sensation of the outgoing
discharge from the nervous centres, the 'feeling of
innervation,' to use Wundt's expression, requisite for bringing
the open eye with its weakened muscle to bear upon
the object to be touched. If that object be situated 20
degrees to the right, the patient has now to innervate as
powerfully to turn the eye those 20 degrees as formerly
he did to turn the eye 30 degrees. He consequently
believes as before that he <i>has</i> turned it 30 degrees; until,
by a newly-acquired custom, he learns the altered spatial
import of all the discharges his brain makes into his right
abducens nerve. The 'feeling of innervation,' maintained
to exist by this and other observations, plays an immense
part in the space-theories of certain philosophers, especially
Wundt. I shall elsewhere try to show that the observations
by no means warrant the conclusions drawn from
them, and that the feeling in question is probably a wholly
fictitious entity.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Meanwhile it suffices to point out that
even those who set most store by it are compelled, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
readiness with which the translocation of the field of view
becomes corrected and further errors avoided, to admit
that the precise space-import of <i>the supposed sensation of
outgoing energy is as ambiguous and indeterminate as that of
any other of the eye-feelings we have considered hitherto.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have now given what no one will call an understatement
of the facts and arguments by which it is sought to
banish the credit of directly revealing space from each and
every kind of eye-sensation taken by itself. The reader
will confess that they make a very plausible show, and
most likely wonder whether my own theory of the matter
can rally from their damaging evidence. But the case is
far from being hopeless; and the introduction of a discrimination
hitherto unmade will, if I mistake not, easily vindicate
the view adopted in these pages, whilst at the same
time it makes ungrudging allowance for all the ambiguity
and illusion on which so much stress is laid by the advocates
of the intellectualist-theory.</p>


<h4><i>The Choice of the Visual Reality.</i></h4>


<p>We <i>have</i> native and fixed optical space-sensations; <i>but
experience leads us to select certain ones from among them to be
the exclusive bearers of reality: the rest become mere signs and
suggesters of these.</i> The factor of <i>selection</i>, on which we have
already laid so much stress, here as elsewhere is the solving
word of the enigma. If Helmholtz, Wundt, and the rest,
with an ambiguous retinal sensation before them, meaning
now one size and distance, and now another, had not contented
themselves with merely saying:&mdash;The size and distance
are not this sensation, they are something beyond it
which it merely calls up, and whose own birthplace is afar&mdash;in
'synthesis' (Wundt) or in 'experience' (Helmholtz) as
the case may be; if they had gone on definitely to ask and
definitely to answer the question, What are the size and
distance in their proper selves? they would not only have
escaped the present deplorable vagueness of their space-theories,
but they would have seen that the objective
spatial attributes 'signified' are simply and solely <i>certain</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
<i>other optical sensations now absent</i>, but which the present
sensations suggest.</p>

<p>What, for example, is the slant-legged cross which we
think we see on the wall when we project the rectangular
after-image high up towards our right or left (Figs. 58 and
59)? Is it not in very sooth a retinal sensation itself? An
imagined sensation, not a felt one, it is true, but none the
less essentially and originally sensational or retinal for that,&mdash;the
sensation, namely, which we should receive if a 'real'
slant-legged cross stood on the wall <i>in front of us</i> and threw
its image on our eye. That image is not the one our retina
now holds. Our retina now holds the image which a cross
of square shape throws when in front, but which a cross of
the slant-legged pattern <i>would</i> throw, provided it were
actually on the wall in the distant place at which we look.
Call this actual retinal image the 'square' image. The
square image is then one of the innumerable images the
slant-legged cross can throw. Why should another one,
and that an absent one, of those innumerable images be
picked out to represent exclusively the slant-legged cross's
'true' shape? Why should that absent and imagined
slant-legged image displace the present and felt square
image from our mind? Why, when the objective cross
gives us so many shapes, as it varies its position, should we
think we feel the true shape only when the cross is directly
in front? And when that question is answered, how can
the absent and represented feeling of a slant-legged figure
so successfully intrude itself into the place of a presented
square one?</p>

<p>Before answering either question, let us be doubly sure
about our facts, and see how true it is that <i>in our dealings
with objects we always do pick out one of the visual images they
yield, to constitute the real form or size.</i></p>

<p>The matter of size has been already touched upon, so
that no more need be said of it here. As regards shape,
almost all the retinal shapes that objects throw are perspective
'distortions.' Square table-tops constantly present two
acute and two obtuse angles; circles drawn on our wall-papers,
our carpets, or on sheets of paper, usually show like
ellipses; parallels approach as they recede; human bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
are foreshortened; and the transitions from one to another
of these altering forms are infinite and continual. Out of
the flux, however, one phase always stands prominent. It
is the form the object has when we see it easiest and best:
and that is when our eyes and the object both are in what
may be called <i>the normal position</i>. In this position our
head is upright and our optic axes either parallel or symmetrically
convergent; the plane of the object is perpendicular
to the visual plane; and if the object is one containing
many lines it is turned so as to make them, as far as possible,
either parallel or perpendicular to the visual plane. In this
situation it is that we compare all shapes with each other;
here every exact measurement and decision is made.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p><i>It is very easy to see why the normal situation should have
this extraordinary pre-eminence.</i> First, it is the position in
which we easiest hold anything we are examining in our
hands; second, it is a turning-point between all right- and
all left-hand perspective views of a given object; third, it
is the only position in which symmetrical figures seem symmetrical
and equal angles seem equal; fourth, it is often
that starting-point of movements from which the eye is
least troubled by axial rotations, by which <i>superposition</i><a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> of
the retinal images of different lines and different parts of
the same line is easiest produced, and consequently by
which the eye can make the best comparative measurements
in its sweeps. All these merits single the normal
position out to be chosen. No other point of view offers
so many æsthetic and practical advantages. Here we believe
we see the object as it <i>is</i>; elsewhere, only as it seems.
Experience and custom soon teach us, however, that the
seeming appearance passes into the real one by continuous
gradations. They teach us, moreover, that seeming and
being may be strangely interchanged. Now a real circle
may slide into a seeming ellipse; now an ellipse may, by
sliding in the same direction, become a seeming circle; now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
a rectangular cross grows slant-legged; now a slant-legged
one grows rectangular.</p>

<p>Almost any form in oblique vision may be thus a derivative
of almost any other in 'primary' vision; and we must
learn, when we get one of the former appearances, to translate
it into the appropriate one of the latter class; we must
learn of what optical 'reality' it is one of the optical signs.
Having learned this, we do but obey that law of economy
or simplification which dominates our whole psychic life,
when we attend exclusively to the 'reality' and ignore as
much as our consciousness will let us the 'sign' by which
we came to apprehend it. The signs of each probable real
thing being multiple and the thing itself one and fixed,
we gain the same mental relief by abandoning the former
for the latter that we do when we abandon mental images,
with all their fluctuating characters, for the definite and
unchangeable <i>names</i> which they suggest. The selection of
the several 'normal' appearances from out of the jungle
of our optical experiences, to serve as the real sights of
which we shall think, is psychologically a parallel phenomenon
to the habit of thinking in words, and has a like use.
Both are substitutions of terms few and fixed for terms
manifold and vague.</p>


<h4><i>Sensations which we Ignore.</i></h4>


<p>This service of sensations as mere signs, to be ignored
when they have evoked the other sensations which are their
significates, was noticed first by Berkeley and remarked in
many passages, as the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Signs, being little considered in themselves, or for their own sake,
but only in their relative capacity and for the sake of those things
whereof they are signs, it comes to pass that the mind overlooks them,
so as to carry its attention immediately on to the things signified ... which
in truth and strictness are not <i>seen</i>, but only <i>suggested</i> and <i>apprehended</i>
by means of the proper objects of sight which alone are
seen." (Divine Visual Language, § 12.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Berkeley of course erred in supposing that the thing
suggested was not even <i>originally</i> an object of sight, as the
sign now is which calls it up. Reid expressed Berkeley's
principle in yet clearer language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The visible appearances of objects are intended by nature only as
signs or indications, and the mind passes instantly to the things signified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
without making the least reflection upon the sign, or even perceiving
that there is any such thing.... The mind has acquired a confirmed
and inveterate habit of inattention to them (the signs). For
they no sooner appear than, quick as lightning, the thing signified succeeds
and engrosses all our regard. They have no name in language;
and although we are conscious of them when they pass through the
mind, yet their passage is so quick and so familiar that it is absolutely
unheeded; nor do they leave any footsteps of themselves, either in the
memory or imagination." (Inquiry, chap. v. §§ 2, 3.)</p></blockquote>

<p>If we review the facts we shall find every grade of non-attention
between the extreme form of overlooking mentioned
by Reid (or forms even more extreme still) and complete
conscious perception of the sensation present. Sometimes
it is literally impossible to become aware of the latter.
Sometimes a little artifice or effort easily leads us to discern
it together, or in alternation, with the 'object' it reveals.
Sometimes the present sensation is held to <i>be</i> the object or
to reproduce its features in undistorted shape, and <i>then</i>, of
course, it receives the mind's full glare.</p>

<p>The deepest inattention is to subjective optical sensations,
strictly so called, or those which are not signs of
outer objects at all. Helmholtz's treatment of these phenomena,
<i>muscæ volitantes</i>, negative after-images, double
images, etc., is very satisfactory. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We only attend with any ease and exactness to our sensations in so
far forth as they can be utilized for the knowledge of outward things;
and we are accustomed to neglect all those portions of them which have
no significance as regards the external world. So much is this the case
that for the most part special artifices and practice are required for
the observation of these latter more subjective feelings. Although it
might seem that nothing should be easier than to be conscious of one's
own sensations, experience nevertheless shows that often enough either a
special talent like that showed in eminent degree by Purkinje, or accident
or theoretic speculation, are necessary conditions for the discovery
of subjective phenomena. Thus, for example, the blind spot on the
retina was discovered by Mariotte by the theoretic way; similarly by
me the existence of 'summation'-tones in acoustics. In the majority
of cases accident is what first led observers whose attention was especially
exercised on subjective phenomena to discover this one or that;
only where the subjective appearances are so intense that they interfere
with the perception of objects are they noticed by all men alike.
But if they have once been discovered it is for the most part easy for
subsequent observers who place themselves in proper conditions and
bend their attention in the right direction to perceive them. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
many cases&mdash;for example, in the phenomena of the blind spot, in the
discrimination of over-tones and combination-tones from the ground-tone
of musical sounds, etc.&mdash;such a strain of the attention is required,
even with appropriate instrumental aids, that most persons fail. The
very after-images of bright objects are by most men perceived only
under exceptionally favorable conditions, and it takes steady practice
to see the fainter images of this kind. It is a commonly recurring experience
that persons smitten with some eye-disease which impairs
vision suddenly remark for the first time the <i>muscæ volitantes</i> which
all through life their vitreous humor has contained, but which they now
firmly believe to have arisen since their malady; the truth being that
the latter has only made them more observant of all their visual sensations.
There are also cases where one eye has gradually grown blind,
and the patient lived for an indefinite time without knowing it, until,
through the accidental closure of the healthy eye alone, the blindness
of the other was brought to attention.</p>

<p>"Most people, when first made aware of binocular double images,
are uncommonly astonished that they should never have noticed them
before, although all through their life they had been in the habit of seeing
singly only those few objects which were about equally distant with
the point of fixation, and the rest, those nearer and farther, which constitute
the great majority, had always been double.</p>

<p>"We must then <i>learn</i> to turn our attention to our particular sensations,
and we learn this commonly only for such sensations as are means
of cognition of the outer world. Only so far as they serve this end have
our sensations any importance for us in ordinary life. Subjective
feelings are mostly interesting only to scientific investigators; were
they remarked in the ordinary use of the senses, they could only cause
disturbance. Whilst, therefore, we reach an extraordinary degree of
firmness and security in objective observation, we not only do not reach
this where subjective phenomena are concerned, but we actually attain
in a high degree the faculty of overlooking these altogether, and keeping
ourselves independent of their influence in judging of objects, even
in cases where their strength might lead them easily to attract our attention."
(Physiol. Optik, pp. 431-2.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Even where the sensation is not merely subjective, as in
the cases of which Helmholtz speaks, but is a sign of something
outward, we are also liable, as Reid says, to overlook
its intrinsic quality and attend exclusively to the image of
the 'thing' it suggests. But here everyone <i>can</i> easily notice
the sensation itself if he will. Usually we see a sheet of
paper as uniformly white, although a part of it may be in
shadow. But we can in an instant, if we please, notice the
shadow as local color. A man walking towards us does
not usually seem to alter his size; but we can, by setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
our attention in a peculiar way make him appear to do so.
The whole education of the artist consists in his learning
to see the presented signs as well as the represented things.
No matter what the field of view <i>means</i>, he sees it also as
it <i>feels</i>&mdash;that is, as a collection of patches of color bounded
by lines&mdash;the whole forming an optical diagram of whose
intrinsic proportions one who is not an artist has hardly a
conscious inkling. The ordinary man's attention passes
<i>over</i> them to their import; the artist's turns back and
dwells <i>upon</i> them for their own sake. 'Don't draw the
thing as it <i>is</i>, but as it <i>looks</i>!' is the endless advice of every
teacher to his pupil; forgetting that what it 'is' is what it
would also 'look,' provided it were placed in what we have
called the 'normal' situation for vision. In this situation
the sensation as 'sign' and the sensation as 'object' coalesce
into one, and there is no contrast between them.</p>


<h4><i>Sensations which seem Suppressed.</i></h4>


<p>But a great difficulty has been made of certain peculiar
cases which we must now turn to consider. They are <i>cases
in which a present sensation, whose existence is supposed to be
proved by its outward conditions being there, seems absolutely
suppressed or changed by the image of the 'thing' it suggests.</i></p>

<p>This matter carries us back to what was said on <a href="#Page_218">p. 218</a>.
The passage there quoted from Helmholtz refers to these
cases. He thinks they conclusively disprove the original
and intrinsic spatiality of any of our retinal sensations;
for if such a one, actually present, had an immanent and
essential space-determination of its own, that might well
be added to and overlaid or even momentarily eclipsed by
suggestions of its signification, but how could it possibly
be altered or completely <i>suppressed</i> thereby? Of actually
present sensations, he says, being <i>suppressed</i> by suggestions
of experience&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have not a single well-attested example. In all those illusions
which are provoked by <i>sensations</i> in the absence of their usually exciting
objects, the mistake never vanishes by the better understanding of
the object really present, and by insight into the cause of deception.
Phosphenes provoked by pressure on the eyeball, by traction on the entrance
of the optic nerve, after-images, etc., remain projected into their
apparent place in the field of vision, just as the image projected from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
a mirror's surface continues to be seen <i>behind</i> the mirror, although we
<i>know</i> that to all these appearances no outward reality corresponds.
True enough, we can remove our attention, and keep it removed, from
sensations that have no reference to the outer world, those, e.g., of the
weaker after-images, and of entoptic objects, etc.... But what would
become of our perceptions at all if we had the power not only of ignoring,
but of <i>transforming into their opposites</i>, any part of them that
differed from that outward experience, the image of which, as that of
a present reality, accompanies them in the mind?"<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the analogy of all other experience, we should expect that the
conquered feelings would persist to our perception, even if only in the
shape of recognized illusions. But this is not the case. One does not
see how the assumption of originally spatial sensations can explain our
optical cognitions, when in the last resort those who believe in these
very sensations find themselves obliged to assume that they are <i>overcome</i>
by our better judgment, based on experience."</p></blockquote>

<p>These words, coming from such a quarter, necessarily
carry great weight. But the authority even of a Helmholtz
ought not to shake one's critical composure. And the moment
one abandons abstract generalities and comes to close
quarters with the particulars, I think one easily sees that
no such conclusions as those we have quoted follow from
the latter. But profitably to conduct the discussion <i>we
must divide the alleged instances into groups.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(a) With Helmholtz, <i>color-perception</i> is equally with space-perception
an intellectual affair. The so-called simultaneous
color-contrast, by which one color modifies another
alongside of which it is said, is explained by him as an
unconscious inference. In <a href="#PSYCHOLOGY">Chapter XVII</a> we discussed the
color-contrast problem; the principles which applied to its
solution will prove also applicable to part of the present
problem. In my opinion, Hering has definitively proved
that, when one color is laid beside another, it modifies the
sensation of the latter, not by virtue of any mere mental
suggestion, as Helmholtz would have it, but by actually
exciting a new nerve-process, to which the modified feeling
of color immediately corresponds. The explanation is
physiological, not psychological. The transformation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the original color by the inducing color is due to the disappearance
of the physiological conditions under which the
first color was produced, and to the induction, under the
new conditions, of a genuine new sensation, with which the
'suggestions of experience' have naught to do.</p>

<img src="images/fig_64.jpg" width="400" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 64.</div>
</div>

<p>That processes in the visual apparatus propagate themselves
laterally, if one may so express it, is also shown by
the <i>phenomena of contrast which occur after looking upon
motions</i> of various kinds. Here are a few examples. If,
over the rail of a moving vessel, we look at the water rushing
along the side, and then transfer our gaze to the deck, a
band of planks will appear to us, moving in the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
direction to that in which, a moment previously, we had
been seeing the water move, whilst on either side of this
band another band of planks will move as the water did.
Looking at a waterfall, or at the road from out of a car-window
in a moving tram, produces the same illusion, which
may be easily verified in the laboratory by a simple piece
of apparatus. A board with a window five or six inches
wide and of any convenient length is supported upright on
two feet. On the back side of the board, above and below
the window, are two rollers, one of which is provided with
a crank. An endless band of any figured stuff is passed
over these rollers (one of which can be so adjusted on its
bearings as to keep the stuff always taut and not liable to
slip), and the surface of the front board is also covered with
stuff or paper of a nature to catch the eye. Turning the
crank now sets the central band in continuous motion,
whilst the margins of the field remain really at rest, but
after a while appear moving in the contrary way. Stopping
the crank results in an illusory appearance of motion in
reverse directions all over the field.</p>

<p>A disk with an Archimedean spiral drawn upon it,
whirled round on an ordinary rotating machine, produces
still more startling effects.</p>

<p>"If the revolution is in the direction in which the spiral line

expand during revolution and to contract after it has ceased; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<i>vice versâ</i> if the movement of revolution is in the opposite direction. If
in the former case the eyes of the observers are turned from the rotating
disk towards any familiar object&mdash;e.g. the face of a friend&mdash;the latter

</div>

<p>An elementary form of these motor illusions seems to be
the one described by Helmholtz on pp. 568-571 of his
Optik. The motion of anything in the field of vision along
an acute angle towards a straight line sensibly distorts
that line. Thus in Fig. 66: Let AB be a line drawn on
paper, CDE the tracing made over this line by the point
of a compass steadily followed by the eye, as it moves. As
the compass-point passes from C to D, the line appears to
move downwards; as it passes from D to E, the line appears
to move upwards; at the same time the whole line seems
to incline itself in the direction FG during the first half
of the compass's movement; and in the direction HI during
its last half; the change from one inclination to another
being quite distinct as the compass-point passes
over D.</p>

<p>Any line across which we draw a pencil-point appears
to be animated by a rapid movement of its own towards
the pencil-point. This apparent movement of both of two
things in relative motion to each other, even when one of
them is absolutely still, reminds us of the instances quoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
from Vierordt on <a href="#Page_188">page 188</a>, and seems to take us back to a
primitive stage of perception, in which the discriminations
we now make when we feel a movement have not yet been
made. If we draw the point of a pencil through 'Zöllner's
pattern' (Fig. 60, <a href="#Page_232">p. 232</a>), and follow it with the eye, the
whole figure becomes the scene of the most singular
apparent unrest, of which Helmholtz has very carefully
noted the conditions. The illusion of Zöllner's figure vanishes
entirely, or almost so, with most people, if they
steadily look at one point of it with an unmoving eye; and
the same is the case with many other illusions.</p>

<p><i>Now all these facts taken together seem to show</i>&mdash;vaguely
it is true, but certainly&mdash;<i>that present excitements and after-effects
of former excitements may alter the result of processes
occurring simultaneously at a distance from them in the retina</i>
or other portions of the apparatus for optical sensation. In
the cases last considered, the moving eye, as it sweeps the
fovea over certain parts of the figure, seems thereby to
determine a modification in the feeling which the <i>other</i> parts
confer, which modification is the figure's 'distortion.' It is
true that this statement explains nothing. It only keeps
the cases to which it applies from being explained spuriously.
<i>The spurious account of these illusions is that they are
intellectual, not sensational, that they are secondary, not primary,
mental facts.</i> The distorted figure is said to be one which
the mind is led to <i>imagine</i>, by falsely drawing an unconscious
inference from certain premises of which it is not
distinctly aware. And the imagined figure is supposed to
be strong enough to suppress the perception of whatever
real sensations there may be. But Helmholtz, Wundt,
Delbœuf, Zöllner, and all the advocates of unconscious inference
are at variance with each other when it comes to
the question what these unconscious premises and inferences
may be.</p>

<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 68.</div>
</div>

<p>That small angles look proportionally larger than larger
ones is, in brief, the fundamental illusion to which almost all
authors would reduce the peculiarity of Fig. 67, as of Figs.
60, 61, 62 (<a href="#Page_232">p. 232</a>). This peculiarity of small angles
is by Wundt treated as the case of a filled space seeming
larger than an empty one, as in Fig. 68; and this, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
to both Delbœuf and Wundt, is owing to the fact that more
muscular innervation is needed for the eye to traverse a
filled space than an empty one, because the points and lines
in the filled space inevitably arrest and constrain the eye,
and this makes us feel as if it were doing more work, i.e.
traversing a longer distance.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> When, however, we recollect
that muscular movements are positively proved to have
<i>no</i> share in the waterfall and revolving-spiral illusions, and
that it is hard to see how Wundt's and Delbœuf's particular
form of muscle-explanation can possibly apply to the compass-point
illusion considered a moment ago, we must conclude
that these writers have probably exaggerated, to say
the least, the reach of their muscle-explanation in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of the subdivided angles and lines. Never do we get such
strong muscular feelings as when, against the course of nature,
we oblige our eyes to be still; but fixing the eyes on
one point of the figure, so far from making that part of the
latter seem larger, dispels, in most persons, the illusion of
these diagrams altogether.</p>

<p>As for Helmholtz, he invokes, to explain the enlargement
of small angles,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> what he calls a '<i>law of contrast</i>'
between directions and distances of lines, analogous to that
between colors and intensities of light. Lines cutting
another line make the latter seem more inclined away from
them than it really is. Moreover, clearly recognizable magnitudes
appear greater than equal magnitudes which we
but vaguely apprehend. But this is surely a sensationalistic
law, a native function of our seeing-apparatus. Quite
as little as the negative after-image of the revolving spiral
could such contrast be deduced from any association of
ideas or recall of past objects. The principle of contrast
is criticised by Wundt,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> who says that by it small spaces
ought to appear to us smaller, and not larger, than they
really are. Helmholtz might have retorted (had not the
retort been as fatal to the uniformity of his own principle
as to Wundt's) that if the muscle-explanation were true, it
ought not to give rise to just the opposite illusions in the
skin. We saw on <a href="#Page_141">p. 141</a> that subdivided spaces appear
shorter than empty ones upon the skin. To the instances
there given add this: Divide a line on paper into equal
halves, puncture the extremities, and make punctures all
along one of the halves; then, with the finger-tip on the
opposite side of the paper, follow the line of punctures;
the empty half will seem much longer than the punctured
half. This seems to bring things back to unanalyzable
laws, by reason of which our feeling of size is determined
differently in the skin and in the retina, even when the
objective conditions are the same. Hering's explanation
of Zöllner's figure is to be found in Hermann's Handb. d.
Physiologie, iii. 1. p. 579. Lipps<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> gives another reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
why lines cutting another line make the latter seem to
bend away from them more than is really the case. If,
he says, we draw (Fig. 69) the line <i>pm</i> upon the line <i>ab</i>,
and follow the latter with our eye, we shall, on reaching
the point <i>m</i>, tend for a moment to slip off <i>ab</i> and to follow
<i>mp</i>, without distinctly realizing that we are not still on the
main line. This makes us feel as if the remainder <i>mb</i> of
the main line were bent a little away from its original direction.
The illusion is apparent in the shape of a seeming
approach of the ends <i>b, b,</i> of the two main lines. This to
my mind would be a more satisfactory explanation of this
class of illusions than any of those given by previous authors,
were it not again for what happens in the skin.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Considering all the circumstances, I feel justified in discarding
his entire batch of illusions as irrelevant to our present
inquiry.</i> Whatever they may prove, they do not prove
that our visual percepts of form and movement may not be
sensations strictly so called. They much more probably
fall into line with the phenomena of irradiation and of
color-contrast, and with Vierordt's primitive illusions of
movement. They show us, if anything, a realm of sensations
in which our habitual experience has not yet made
traces, and which persist in spite of our better knowledge,
<i>un</i>suggestive of those other space-sensations which we all
the time know from extrinsic evidence to constitute the real
space-determinations of the diagram. Very likely, if these
sensations were as frequent and as practically important as
they now are insignificant and rare, we should end by substituting
their significates&mdash;the real space-values of the
diagrams&mdash;for them. These latter we should then seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
see directly, and the illusions would disappear like that of
the size of a tooth-socket when the tooth has been out a
week.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>(b) Another batch of cases which we may discard is that of
double images</i>. A thoroughgoing anti-sensationalist ought
to deny all native tendency to see double images when
disparate retinal points are stimulated, because, he should
say, most people never get them, but <i>see</i> all things single
which experience has led them to believe to <i>be</i> single.
"Can a doubleness, so easily neutralized by our knowledge,
ever be a datum of sensation at all?" such an anti-sensationalist
might ask.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/fig_70.jpg" width="475" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 70.</div>
</div>

<p>To which the answer is that it <i>is</i> a datum of sensation,
but a datum which, like many other data, must first be
<i>discriminated</i>. As a rule, no sensible qualities are discriminated
without a motive.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> And those that later we
learn to discriminate were originally felt confused. As
well pretend that a voice, or an odor, which we have
learned to pick out, is no sensation now. One may easily
acquire skill in discriminating double images, though, as
Hering somewhere says, it is an art of which one cannot
become master in one year or in two. For masters like
Hering himself, or Le Conte, the ordinary stereoscopic diagrams
are of little use. Instead of combining into one solid
appearance, they simply cross each other with their doubled
lines. Volkmann has shown a great variety of ways in
which the addition of secondary lines, differing in the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
fields, helps us to see the primary lines double. The effect
is analogous to that shown in the cases which we despatched
a moment ago, where given lines have their space-value
changed by the addition of new lines, without our being
able to say why, except that a certain mutual adhesion of
the lines and modification of the resultant feeling takes
place by psychophysiological laws. Thus, if in Fig. 70, <i>l</i>
and <i>r</i> be crossed by an horizontal line at the same level,
and viewed stereoscopically, they appear as a single pair of
lines, <i>s</i>, in space. But if the horizontal be at different
levels, as in <i>l', r',</i> three lines appear, as in <i>s'</i>'.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Let us then say no more about double images. All that
the facts prove is what Volkmann says,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> that, although
there may be sets of retinal fibres so organized as to give
an impression of two separate spots, yet the excitement of
other retinal fibres may inhibit the effect of the first excitement,
and prevent us from actually making the discrimination.
Still farther retinal processes may, however,
bring the doubleness to the eye of attention; and, once
there, it is as genuine a sensation as any that our life
affords.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>(c) These groups of illusions being eliminated,</i> either as cases
of defective discrimination, or as changes of one space-sensation
into another when the total retinal process
changes, <i>there remain but two other groups to puzzle us.</i> The
first is that of the after-images distorted by projection on to
oblique planes; the second relates to the instability of
our judgments of relative distance and size by the eye,
and includes especially what are known as pseudoscopic
illusions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>
<p>The phenomena of the first group were described on
<a href="#Page_232">page 232</a>. A. W. Volkmann has studied them with his
accustomed clearness and care.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Even an imaginarily
inclined wall, in a picture, will, if an after-image be thrown
upon it, distort the shape thereof, and make us <i>see</i> a form
of which our after-image would be the natural projection
on the retina, were that form laid upon the wall. Thus a
signboard is painted in perspective on a screen, and the
eye, after steadily looking at a rectangular cross, is turned
to the painted signboard. The after-image appears as an
oblique-legged cross upon the signboard. It is the converse
phenomenon of a perspective drawing like Fig. 71, in which
really oblique-legged figures are seen as rectangular crosses.</p>

</div>

<p>The unstable judgments of relative distance and size
were also mentioned on <a href="#Page_231">pp. 231-2</a>. Whatever the size may
be of the retinal image which an object makes, the object is
seen as of its own normal size. A man moving towards us
is not sensibly perceived to <i>grow</i>, for example; and my
finger, of which a single joint may more than conceal him
from my view, is nevertheless seen as a much smaller object
than the man. As for distances, it is often possible to make
the farther part of an object seem near and the nearer part
far. A human profile in intaglio, looked at steadily with
one eye, or even both, soon appears irresistibly as a bas-relief.
The inside of a common pasteboard mask, painted
like the outside, and viewed with one eye in a direct light,
also looks convex instead of hollow. So strong is the illusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
after long fixation, that a friend who painted such a
mask for me told me it soon became difficult to see how to
apply the brush. Bend a visiting-card across the middle,
so that its halves form an angle of 90º more or less; set it
upright on the table, as in Fig. 72, and view it with one eye.
You can make it appear either as if it opened towards you
or away from you. In the former case, the angle <i>ab</i> lies
upon the table, <i>b</i> being nearer to you than <i>a</i>; in the latter
case <i>ab</i> seems vertical to the table&mdash;as indeed it really is&mdash;with
<i>a</i> nearer to you than <i>b</i>.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Again, look, with either one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
two eyes, at the opening of a wine-glass or tumbler (Fig.
73), held either above or below the eye's level. The retinal
image of the opening is an oval, but we can see the oval in
either of two ways,&mdash;as if it were the perspective view of a
circle whose edge <i>b</i> were farther from us than its edge <i>a</i>
(in which case we should seem to be looking down on the
circle), or as if its edge <i>a</i> were the more distant edge (in
which case we should be looking up at it through the <i>b</i> side
of the glass). As the manner of seeing the edge changes,
the glass itself alters its form in space and looks straight
or seems bent towards or from the eye,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> according as the
latter is placed beneath or above it.</p>

<p>Plane diagrams also can be conceived as solids, and that
in more than one way. Figs. 74, 75, 76, for example, are ambiguous
perspective projections, and may each of them remind
us of two different natural objects. Whichever of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
objects we conceive clearly at the moment of looking at the
figure, we seem to <i>see</i> in all its solidity before us. A little practice
will enable us to flap the figures, so to speak, backwards
and forwards from one object to the other at will. We need
only attend to one of the angles represented, and imagine it
either solid or hollow&mdash;pulled towards us out of the plane
of the paper, or pushed back behind the same&mdash;and the
whole figure obeys the cue and is instantaneously transformed
beneath our gaze.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>The peculiarity of all these cases is the ambiguity of
the perception to which the fixed retinal impression gives
rise. With our retina excited in exactly the same way,
whether by after-image, mask or diagram, we <i>see</i> now this
object and now that, as if the retinal image <i>per se</i> had no
essential space-import. Surely if form and length were
originally retinal sensations, retinal rectangles ought not to
become acute or obtuse, and lines ought not to alter their
relative lengths as they do. If <i>relief</i> were an optical
feeling, it ought not to flap to and fro, with every optical condition
unchanged. Here, if anywhere, the deniers of space-sensation
ought to be able to make their final stand.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>It must be confessed that their plea is plausible at first
sight. But it is one thing to throw out retinal sensibility
altogether as a space-yielding function the moment we find
an ambiguity in its deliverances, and another thing to
examine candidly the conditions which may have brought
the ambiguity about. The former way is cheap, wholesale,
shallow; the latter difficult and complicated, but full of
instruction in the end. Let us try it for ourselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the case of the diagrams 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, the real
object, lines meeting or crossing each other on a plane, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
replaced by an <i>imagined solid which we describe as seen.
Really it is not seen but only so vividly conceived as to
approach a vision of reality.</i> We feel all the while, however,
that the solid suggested is not solidly there. <i>The reason</i>
why one solid may seem more easily suggested than
another, and <i>why it is easier in general to perceive the
diagram solid than flat, seems due to probability.</i><a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Those
lines have countless times in our past experience been
drawn on our retina by solids for once that we have seen
them flat on paper. And hundreds of times we have
looked down upon the upper surface of parallelopipeds,
stairs and glasses, for once that we have looked upwards
at their bottom&mdash;hence we see the solids easiest as if from
above.</p>

<p>Habit or probability seems also to govern the illusion of
the intaglio profile, and of the hollow mask. We have <i>never</i>
seen a human face except in relief&mdash;hence the case with
which the present sensation is overpowered. Hence, too,
the obstinacy with which human faces and forms, and
other extremely familiar convex objects, refuse to appear
hollow when viewed through Wheatstone's pseudoscope.
Our perception seems wedded to certain total ways of
seeing certain objects. The moment the object is suggested
at all, it takes possession of the mind in the fulness of its
stereotyped habitual form. This explains the suddenness
of the transformations when the perceptions change. The
object shoots back and forth completely from this to that
familiar thing, and doubtful, indeterminate, and composite
things are excluded, apparently because we are <i>unused</i> to
their existence.</p>

<p>When we turn from the diagrams to the actual folded
visiting-card and to the real glass, the imagined form seems
fully as real as the correct one. The card flaps over; the
glass rim tilts this way or that, as if some inward spring
suddenly became released in our eye. In these changes the
actual retinal image receives different <i>complements from the
mind</i>. But the remarkable thing is that the complement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
and the image combine so completely that the twain are
one flesh, as it were, and cannot be discriminated in the
result. If the complement be, as we have called it (on <a href="#Page_237">pp.
237-8</a>), a set of imaginary absent eye-sensations, they seem
no whit less vividly there than the sensation which the eye
now receives from without.</p>

<p>The case of the after-images distorted by projection upon
an oblique plane is even more strange, for the imagined
perspective figure, lying in the plane, seems less to combine
with the one a moment previously seen by the eye than to
suppress it and take its place.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The point needing explanation,
then, in all this, is how it comes to pass that, when
imagined sensations are usually so inferior in vivacity to real
ones, they should in these few experiences prove to be
almost or quite their match.</p>

<p>The mystery is solved when we note the class to which
all these experiences belong. They are 'perceptions' of
definite 'things,' definitely situated in tridimensional space.
The mind uniformly uses its sensations to <i>identify things by</i>.
The sensation is invariably apperceived by the idea, name,
or 'normal' aspect (<a href="#Page_238">p. 238</a>) of the <i>thing</i>. The peculiarity of
the <i>optical</i> signs of things is their extraordinary mutability.
A 'thing' which we follow with the eye, never doubting of
its physical identity, will change its retinal image incessantly.
A cross, a ring, waved about in the air, will pass
through every conceivable angular and elliptical form. All
the while, however, as we look at them, we hold fast to the
perception of their 'real' shape, by mentally combining
the pictures momentarily received with the notion of peculiar
positions in space. It is not the cross and ring pure and
simple which we perceive, but the cross <i>so held</i>, the ring <i>so
held</i>. From the day of our birth we have sought every hour
of our lives to <i>correct</i> the apparent form of things, and translate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
it into the real form by keeping note of the way they
are placed or held. In no other class of sensations does
this incessant correction occur. What wonder, then, that
the notion 'so placed' should invincibly exert its habitual
corrective effect, even when the object with which it combines
is only an after-image, and make us perceive the latter
under a changed but more 'real' form? The 'real' form
is also a sensation conjured up by memory; but it is one so
<i>probable</i>, so <i>habitually</i> conjured up when we have just this
combination of optical experiences, that it partakes of the
invincible freshness of reality, and seems to break through
that law which elsewhere condemns reproductive processes
to being so much fainter than sensations.</p>

<p>Once more, <i>these cases form an extreme. Somewhere, in
the list of our imaginations of absent feelings, there must be found
the vividest of all. These optical reproductions of real form are
the vividest of all.</i> It is foolish to reason from cases lower
in the scale, to prove that the scale can contain no such extreme
cases as these; and particularly foolish since we can
definitely see why these imaginations ought to be more
vivid than any others, whenever they recall the forms of
habitual and probable things. These latter, by incessantly
repeated presence and reproduction, will plough deep
grooves in the nervous system. There will be developed,
to correspond to them, paths of least resistance, of unstable
equilibrium, liable to become active in their totality when
any point is touched off. Even when the objective stimulus
is imperfect, we shall still <i>see</i> the full convexity of a human
face, the correct inclination of an angle or sweep of a curve,
or the distance of two lines. Our mind will be like a polyhedron,
whose facets are the attitudes of perception in which
it can most easily rest. These are worn upon it by <i>habitual</i>
objects, and from one of these it can pass only by tumbling
over into another.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Hering has well accounted for the sensationally vivid
character of these habitually reproduced forms. He says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
after reminding us that every visual sensation is correlated
to a physical process in the nervous apparatus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If this psycho-physical process is aroused, as usually happens, by
light-rays impinging on the retina, its form depends not only on the nature
of these rays, but on the constitution of the entire nervous apparatus
which is connected with the organ of vision, and on the <i>state</i> in
which it finds itself. The same stimulus may excite widely different
sensations according to this state.</p>

<p>"The constitution of the nervous apparatus depends naturally in
part upon innate predisposition; but the <i>ensemble</i> of effects wrought by
stimuli upon it in the course of life, whether these come through the eyes
or from elsewhere, is a co-factor of its development. To express it
otherwise, involuntary and voluntary experience and exercise assist in
determining the material structure of the nervous organ of vision, and
hence the ways in which it may react on a retinal image as an outward
stimulus. That experience and exercise should be possible at all in
vision is a consequence of the reproductive power, or memory, of its
nerve-substance. Every particular activity of the organ makes it more
suited to a repetition of the <i>same</i>; ever slighter touches are required to
make the repetition occur. The organ habituates itself to the repeated
activity....</p>

<p>"Suppose now that, in the first experience of a complex sensation
produced by a particular retinal image, certain portions were made the
special objects of attention. In a repetition of the sensible experience
it will happen that notwithstanding the identity of the outward stimulus
these portions will be more easily and strongly reproduced; and when
this happens a hundred times the inequality with which the various
constituents of the complex sensation appeal to consciousness grows
ever greater.</p>

<p>"Now in the present state of our knowledge we cannot assert that
in both the first and the last occurrence of the retinal image in question
the same <i>pure sensation</i> is provoked, but that the mind <i>interprets</i> it
differently the last time in consequence of experience; for the only
<i>given</i> things we know are on the one hand the retinal image which is
both times the same, and on the other the mental percept which is both
times different; of a third thing, such as a pure sensation, interpolated
between image and percept, we know nothing. We ought, therefore,
if we wish to avoid hypotheses, simply to say that the nervous apparatus
reacts the last time differently from the first, and gives us in consequence
a different group of sensations.</p>

<p>"But not only by repetition of the same retinal image, but by that
of similar ones, will the law obtain. Portions of the image common to
the successive experiences will awaken, as it were, a stronger echo in
the nervous apparatus than other portions. Hence it results that <i>reproduction
is usually elective</i>: the more strongly reverberating parts of the
picture yield stronger feelings than the rest. This may result in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
latter being quite overlooked and, as it were, eliminated from perception.
It may even come to pass that instead of these parts eliminated by election
a feeling of entirely different elements comes to consciousness-elements
not objectively contained in the stimulus. A group of sensations,
namely, for which a strong tendency to reproduction has become,
by frequent repetition, ingrained in the nervous system will easily revive
as a <i>whole</i> when, not its whole retinal image, but only an essential part
thereof, returns. In this case we get some sensations to which no adequate
stimulus exists in the retinal image, and which owe their being
solely to the reproductive power of the nervous apparatus. This is
<i>complementary (ergänzende) reproduction</i>.</p>

<p>"Thus a few points and disconnected strokes are sufficient to make
us see a human face, and without specially directed attention we fail to
note that we see much that really is not drawn on the paper. Attention
will show that the outlines were deficient in spots where we thought
them complete.... The portions of the percept supplied by complementary
reproduction depend, however, just as much as its other portions,
on the reaction of the nervous apparatus upon the retinal image,
indirect though this reaction may, in the case of the supplied portions,
be. And so long as they are present, we have a perfect right to call
them sensations, for they differ in no wise from such sensations as correspond
to an actual stimulus in the retina. Often, however, they are
not persistent; many of them may be expelled by more close observation,
but this is not proved to be the case with all.... In vision with
one eye ... the distribution of parts within the third dimension is
essentially the work of this complementary reproduction, i.e. of former
experience.... When a certain way of localizing a particular group
of sensations has become with us a second nature, our better knowledge,
our judgment, our logic, are of no avail.... Things actually
diverse may give similar or almost identical retinal images; e.g., an
object extended in three dimensions, and its flat perspective picture.
In such cases it often depends on small accidents, and especially on our
will, whether the one or the other group of sensations shall be excited....
We can see a relief hollow, as a mould, or <i>vice versâ</i>; for a relief
illuminated from the left can look just like its mould illuminated from
the right. Reflecting upon this, one may infer from the direction of
the shadows that one has a relief before one, and the idea of the relief
will guide the nerve-processes into the right path, so that <i>the feeling</i> of
the relief is suddenly aroused.... Whenever the retinal image is of
such a nature that two diverse modes of reaction on the part of the
nervous apparatus are, so to speak, equally, or nearly equally, imminent,
it must depend on small accidents whether the one or the other
reaction is realized. In these cases our previous knowledge often has a
decisive effect, and helps the correct perception to victory. The bare
idea of the right object is itself a feeble reproduction which with the
help of the proper retinal picture develops into clear and lively sensation.
But if there be not already in the nervous apparatus a disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
to the production of that percept which our judgment tells us is
right, our knowledge strives in vain to conjure up the feeling of it;
we then know that we see something to which no reality corresponds,
but we see it all the same."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Note that no object not probable, no object which we are not
incessantly practised in reproducing, can acquire this vividness
in imagination.</i> Objective corners are ever changing their
angles to the eyes, spaces their apparent size, lines their
distance. But by no transmutation of position in space
does an objective straight line appear bent, and only in one
position out of an infinity does a broken line look straight.
Accordingly, it is impossible by projecting the after-image
of a straight line upon two surfaces which make a solid
angle with each other to give the line itself a sensible
'kink.' Look with it at the corner of your room: the
after-image, which may overlap all three surfaces of the
corner, still continues straight. Volkmann constructed a
complicated surface of projection like that drawn in Fig.
77, but he found it impossible so to throw a straight after-image
upon it as to alter its visible form.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>
<p>One of the situations in which we oftenest see things is
spread out on the ground before us. We are incessantly
drilled in making allowance for <i>this</i> perspective, and reducing
things to their real form in spite of optical foreshortening.
Hence if the preceding explanations are true, we
ought to find this habit inveterate. The <i>lower</i> half of the
retina, which habitually sees the <i>farther</i> half of things
spread out on the ground, ought to have acquired a habit
of enlarging its pictures by imagination, so as to make
them more than equal to those which fall on the upper
retinal surface; and this habit ought to be hard to escape
from, even when both halves of the object are equidistant
from the eye, as in a vertical line on paper. Delbœuf has
found, accordingly, that if we try to bisect such a line we
place the point of division about of its length too high.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Similarly, a square cross, or a square, drawn on paper,
should look higher than it is broad. And that this is actually
the case, the reader may verify by a glance at Fig. 78.
For analogous reasons the upper and lower halves of the
letter S, or of the figure 8, hardly seem to differ. But when
turned upside down, the upper half looks much the
larger.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Hering has tried to explain our exaggeration of small
angles in the same way. We have more to do with right
angles than with any others: right angles, in fact, have an
altogether unique sort of interest for the human mind.
Nature almost never begets them, but we think space by
means of them and put them everywhere. Consequently
obtuse and acute ones, liable always to be the images of
right ones foreshortened, particularly easily revive right
ones in memory. It is hard to look at such figures as
<i>a, b, c,</i> in Fig. 79, without seeing them in perspective, as
approximations, at least, to foreshortened rectangular
forms.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>At the same time the genuine sensational form of the
lines before us can, in all the cases of distortion by suggested
perspective, be felt correctly by a mind able to abstract
from the notion of perspective altogether. Individuals
differ in this abstracting power. Artistic training improves
it, so that after a little while errors in vertical bisection,
in estimating height relatively to breadth, etc., become
impossible. In other words, we learn to take the
optical sensation before us <i>pure</i>.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p><i>We may then sum up our study of illusions by saying that
they in no wise undermine our view that every spatial determination
of things is originally given in the shape of a sensation
of the eyes.</i> They only show how very potent certain
<i>imagined</i> sensations of the eyes may become.</p>

<p>These sensations, so far as they bring definite forms to
the mind, appear to be retinal exclusively. The movements
of the eyeballs play a great part in educating our
perception, it is true; but they have nothing to do with
<i>constituting</i> any one feeling of form. Their function is
limited to <i>exciting</i> the various feelings of form, by tracing
retinal streaks; and to <i>comparing</i> them, and <i>measuring</i> them
off against each other, by applying different parts of the
retinal surface to the same objective thing. Helmholtz's
analysis of the facts of our '<i>measurement of the field of view</i>'
is, bating a lapse or two, masterly, and seems to prove that
the movements of the eye have had some part in bringing
our sense of retinal equivalencies about&mdash;<i>equivalencies</i>, mind,
of different retinal forms and sizes, not forms and sizes
themselves. <i>Superposition</i> is the way in which the eye-movements
accomplish this result. An object traces the
line AB on a peripheral tract of the retina. Quickly we
move the eye so that the same object traces the line <i>ab</i> on
a central tract. Forthwith, to our mind, AB and <i>ab</i> are
judged equivalent. But, as Helmholtz admits, the equivalence-judgment
is independent of the way in which we
may feel the form and length of the several retinal pictures
themselves:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The retina is like a pair of compasses, whose points we apply in
succession to the ends of several lines to see whether they agree or not in
length. All we need know meanwhile about the compasses is that the
distance of their points remains unchanged. What that distance is, and
what is the shape of the compasses, is a matter of no account."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Measurement implies a stuff to measure. Retinal sensations
give the stuff; objective things form the yardstick; motion
does the measuring operation;</i> which can, of course, be
well performed only where it is possible to make the same
object fall on many retinal tracts. This is practically impossible
where the tracts make a wide angle with each
other. But there are certain directions in the field of view,
certain retinal lines, along which it is particularly easy to
make the image of an object slide. The object then becomes
a 'ruler' for these lines, as Helmholtz puts it,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
making them seem straight throughout if the object looked
straight to us in that part of them at which it was most
distinctly seen.</p>

<p>But all this need of superposition shows how devoid of
exact space-import the feelings of movement are <i>per se</i>. As
we compare the space-value of two retinal tracts by superposing
them successively upon the same objective line, so
we also have to compare the space-value of objective angles
and lines by superposing them on the same retinal tract.
Neither procedure would be required if our eye-movements
were apprehended immediately, by pure muscular feeling
or innervation, for example, as distinct lengths and directions
in space. To compare retinal tracts, it would then
suffice simply to notice how it feels to move <i>any</i> image over
them. And two objective lines could be compared as
well by moving different retinal tracts along them as by
laying them along the same. It would be as easy to compare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
non-parallel figures as it now is to judge of those
which are parallel.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Those which it took the same amount
of movement to traverse would be equal, in whatever direction
the movement occurred.</p>


<h4>GENERAL SUMMARY.</h4>


<p>With this we may end our long and, I fear to many
readers, tediously minute survey. The facts of vision form
a jungle of intricacy; and those who penetrate deeply into
physiological optics will be more struck by our omissions
than by our abundance of detail. But for students who
may have lost sight of the forest for the trees, I will recapitulate
briefly the points of our whole argument from
the beginning, and then proceed to a short historical survey,
which will set them in relief.</p>

<p>All our sensations are positively and inexplicably extensive
wholes.</p>

<p>The sensations contributing to space-<i>perception</i> seem
exclusively to be the surface of skin, retina, and joints.
'Muscular' feelings play no appreciable part in the generation
of our feelings of form, direction, etc.</p>

<p>The total bigness of a cutaneous or retinal feeling soon
becomes subdivided by discriminative attention.</p>

<p><i>Movements</i> assist this discrimination by reason of the
peculiarly exciting quality of the sensations which stimuli
moving over surfaces arouse.</p>

<p>Subdivisions, once discriminated, acquire definite relations
of position towards each other within the total space.
These 'relations' are themselves feelings of the subdivisions
that intervene. When these subdivisions are not the
seat of stimuli, the relations are only reproduced in imaginary
form.</p>

<p>The various sense-spaces are, in the first instance, incoherent
with each other; and primitively both they and
their subdivisions are but vaguely comparable in point of
bulk and form.</p>

<p>The <i>education</i> of our space-perception consists largely
of two processes&mdash;reducing the various sense-feelings to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
common <i>measure</i>, and <i>adding them together</i> into the single
all-including space of the real world.</p>

<p>Both the measuring and the adding are performed by
the aid of <i>things</i>.</p>

<p>The imagined aggregate of positions occupied by all the
actual or possible, moving or stationary, things which we
know, is our notion of 'real' space&mdash;a very incomplete
and vague conception in all minds.</p>

<p>The <i>measuring</i> of our space-feelings against each other
mainly comes about through the successive arousal of different
ones by the same <i>thing</i>, by our selection of certain
ones as feelings of its <i>real</i> size and shape, and by the degradation
of others to the status of being merely <i>signs</i> of
these.</p>

<p>For the successive application of the same thing to different
space-giving surfaces motion is indispensable, and
hence plays a great part in our space-education, especially
in that of the eye. Abstractly considered, the motion of
the object over the sensitive surface would educate us quite
as well as that of the surface over the object. But the self-mobility
of the organ carrying the surface <i>accelerates</i> immensely
the result.</p>

<p>In completely educated space-perception, the present
sensation is usually just what Helmholtz (Physiol. Optik,
p. 797) calls it, 'a sign, the interpretation of whose meaning
is left to the understanding.' But the understanding is
exclusively reproductive and never productive in the process;
and its function is limited to the recall of previous
space-sensations with which the present one has been associated
and which may be judged more real than it.</p>

<p>Finally, this reproduction may in the case of certain
visual forms be as vivid, or almost so, as actual sensation is.</p>

<p>The third dimension forms an original element of all
our space-sensations. In the eye it is subdivided by various
discriminations. The more distant subdivisions are often
shut out altogether, and, in being suppressed, have the
effect of diminishing the absolute space-value of the total
field of view.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<h4>HISTORICAL.</h4>


<p>Let us now close with a brief historical survey. The
first achievement of note in the study of space-perception
was Berkeley's theory of vision. This undertook to establish
two points, first that <i>distance</i> was not a visual but a tactile
form of consciousness, suggested by visual signs; secondly,
that there is no one quality or 'idea' common to the sensations
of touch and sight, such that prior to experience one
might possibly anticipate from the look of an object anything
about its felt size, shape, or position, or from the
touch of it anything about its look.</p>

<p>In other words, that primitively chaotic or semi-chaotic
condition of our various sense-spaces which we have
demonstrated, was established for good by Berkeley; and
he bequeathed to psychology the problem of describing the
manner in which the deliverances are harmonized so as all
to refer to one and the same extended world.</p>

<p>His disciples in Great Britain have solved this problem
after Berkeley's own fashion, and to a great extent as we
have done ourselves, by the ideas of the various senses suggesting
each other in consequence of Association. But, either
because they were intoxicated with the principle of association,
or because in the number of details they lost their
general bearings, they have forgotten, as a rule, to state <i>under
what sensible form the primitive spatial experiences are found</i>
which later became associated with so many other sensible
signs. Heedless of their master Locke's precept, that the
mind can frame unto itself no one new simple idea, they
seem for the most part to be trying to <i>explain the extensive
quality itself</i>, account for it, and evolve it, by the mere association
together of feelings which originally possessed it not.
They first evaporate the nature of extension by making it
tantamount to mere 'coexistence,' and then they explain
coexistence as being the same thing as <i>succession</i>, provided it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
be an extremely rapid or a reversible succession. Space-perception
thus emerges without being anywhere postulated.
The only things postulated are unextended feelings and time.
Says Thomas Brown (lecture xxiii.): "I am inclined to reverse
exactly the process commonly supposed; and instead
of deriving the measure of time from extension, to derive
the knowledge and original measure of extension from time."
Brown and both the Mills think that retinal sensations,
colors, in their primitive condition, are felt with no extension
and that the latter merely becomes inseparably associated
with them. John Mill says: "Whatever may be the retinal
impression conveyed by a line which bounds two colors, I
see no ground for thinking that by the eye alone we could
acquire the conception of what we now mean when we say
that one of the colors is outside [beside] the other."<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Whence does the extension come which gets so inseparably
associated with these non-extended colored sensations?
From the 'sweep and movements' of the <i>eye</i>&mdash;from muscular
feelings. But, as Prof. Bain says, if movement-feelings
give us any property of things, "it would seem to be
not space, but time."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> And John Mill says that "the idea
of space is, at bottom, one of time."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Space, then, is not to
be found in any elementary sensation, but, in Bain's words,
"as a quality, it has no other origin and no other meaning
than the <i>association</i> of these different [non-spatial] motor
and sensitive effects."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>This phrase is mystical-sounding enough to one who
understands association as <i>producing</i> nothing, but only as
knitting together things already produced in separate ways.
The truth is that the English Associationist school, in trying
to show how much their principle can accomplish, have
altogether overshot the mark and espoused a kind of theory
in respect to space-perception which the general tenor of
their philosophy should lead them to abhor. Really there
are but three possible kinds of theory concerning space.
Either (1) there is no spatial <i>quality</i> of sensation at all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
space is a mere symbol of succession; or (2) there is an <i>extensive
quality given</i> immediately in certain particular sensations;
or, finally, (3) there is a <i>quality produced</i> out of the
inward resources of the mind, to envelop sensations which,
as given originally, are not spatial, but which, on being
cast into the spatial form, become united and orderly. This
last is the Kantian view. Stumpf admirably designates it
as the 'psychic stimulus' theory, the crude sensations being
considered as goads to the mind to put forth its slumbering
power.</p>

<p>Brown, the Mills, and Bain, amid these possibilities,
seem to have gone astray like lost sheep. With the 'mental
chemistry' of which the Mills speak&mdash;precisely the
same thing as the 'psychical synthesis' of Wundt, which,
as we shall soon see, is a principle expressly intended to do
what Association can never perform&mdash;they hold the third
view, but again in other places imply the first. And, between
the impossibility of getting from mere association
anything not contained in the sensations associated and the
dislike to allow spontaneous mental productivity, they
flounder in a dismal dilemma. Mr. Sully joins them there
in what I must call a vague and vacillating way. Mr.
Spencer of course is bound to pretend to 'evolve' all
mental qualities out of antecedents different from themselves,
so that we need perhaps not wonder at his refusal
to accord the spatial quality to any of the several elementary
sensations out of which our space-perception grows.
Thus (Psychology, ii. 168, 172, 218):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No idea of extension can arise from a <i>simultaneous</i> excitation" of
a multitude of nerve-terminations like those of the skin or the retina,
since this would imply a "knowledge of their relative positions"&mdash;that
is, "a pre-existent idea of a special extension, which is absurd." "No
relation between <i>successive</i> states of consciousness gives in itself any
idea of extension." "The muscular sensations accompanying motion
are quite distinct from the notions of space and time associated with
them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Spencer none the less inveighs vociferously against
the Kantian position that space is produced by the mind's
own resources. And yet he nowhere denies space to be a
specific affection of consciousness different from time!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>
<p>Such incoherency is pitiful. The fact is that, at bottom,
all these authors are really 'psychical stimulists,' or Kantists.
The space they speak of is a super-sensational mental
product. This position appears to me thoroughly mythological.
But let us see how it is held by those who know
more definitely what they mean. Schopenhauer expresses
the Kantian view with more vigor and clearness than anyone
else. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A man must be forsaken by all the gods to dream that the world we
see outside of us, filling space in its three dimensions, moving down the
inexorable stream of time, governed at each step by Causality's invariable
law,&mdash;but in all this only following rules which we may prescribe for it
in advance of all experience,&mdash;to dream, I say, that such a world should
stand there outside of us, quite objectively real with no complicity of
ours, and thereupon by a subsequent <i>act</i>, through the instrumentality
of mere sensation, that it should enter our head and reconstruct a duplicate
of itself as it was outside. For what a poverty-stricken thing is this
mere sensation! Even in the noblest organs of sense it is nothing more
than a local and specific feeling, susceptible within its kind of a few
variations, but always strictly subjective and containing in itself nothing
objective, nothing resembling a perception. For sensation of every
sort is and remains a process in the organism itself. As such it is limited
to the territory inside the skin and can never, accordingly, <i>per se</i> contain
anything that lies outside the skin or outside ourselves.... Only
when the Understanding ... is roused to activity and brings its
sole and only form, the <i>law of Causality</i>, into play, only then does the
mighty transformation take place which makes out of subjective sensation
objective intuition. The Understanding, namely, grasps by means
of its innate, <i>a priori</i>, ante-experiential form, the given sensation of the
body as an <i>effect</i> which as such must necessarily have a <i>cause</i>. At the
same time the Understanding summons to its aid the form of the outer
sense which similarly lies already preformed in the intellect (or brain),
and which is Space, in order to locate that cause outside of the organism....
In this process the Understanding, as I shall soon show, takes
note of the most minute peculiarities of the given sensation in order to
construct in the outer space a cause which shall completely account for
them. This operation of the Understanding is, however, not one that
takes place discursively, reflectively, <i>in abstracto</i>, by means of words
and concepts; but is intuitive and immediate.... Thus the Understanding
must first create the objective world; never can the latter,
already complete <i>in se</i>, simply promenade into our heads through the
senses and organic apertures. For the senses yield us nothing further
than the raw material which must be first elaborated into the objective
conception of an orderly physical world-system by means of the aforesaid
simple forms of Space, Time, and Causality.... Let me show the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
great chasm between sensation and perception by showing how raw the
material is out of which the fair structure is upreared. Only two senses
serve objective perception: touch and sight. They alone furnish the
data on the basis whereof the Understanding, by the process indicated,
erects the objective world.... These data in themselves are still no
perception; that is the Understanding's work. If I press with my hand
against the table, the sensation I receive has no analogy with the idea
of the firm cohesion of the parts of this mass: only when my Understanding
passes from the sensation to its cause does it create for itself
a body with the properties of solidity, impenetrability, and hardness.
When in the dark I lay my hand on a surface, or grasp a ball of three
inches diameter, in either case the same parts of the hand receive the
impression: but out of the different contraction of the hand in the two
cases my Understanding constructs the form of the body whose contact
caused the feeling, and confirms its construction by leading me to move
my hand over the body. If one born blind handles a cubical body, the
sensations of his hand are quite uniform on all sides and in all directions,&mdash;only
the corners press upon a smaller part of his skin. In these
sensations, as such, there is nothing whatever analogous to a cube. But
from the felt resistance his Understanding infers immediately and
intuitively a cause thereof, which now presents itself as a solid body;
and from the movements of exploration which the arms made whilst
the feelings of the hands remained constant he constructs, in the space
known to him <i>a priori</i>, the body's cubical shape. Did he not bring
with him ready-made the idea of a cause and of a space, with the laws
thereof, there never could arise, out of those successive feelings in his
hand, the image of a cube. If we let a string run through our closed
hand, we immediately construct as the cause of the friction and its duration
in such an attitude of the hand, a long cylindrical body moving
uniformly in one direction. But never out of the pure sensation in the
hand could the idea of movement, that is, of change of position in space
by means of time, arise: such a content can never lie in sensation, nor
come out of it. Our Intellect, antecedently to all experience, must bear
in itself the intuitions of Space and Time, and therewithal of the possibility
of motion, and no less the idea of Causality, to pass from the
empirically given feeling to its cause, and to construct the latter as a
so moving body of the designated shape. For how great is the abyss
between the mere sensation in the hand and the ideas of causality,
materiality, and movement through Space, occurring in Time! The
feeling in the hand, even with different contacts and positions, is something
far too uniform and poor in content for it to be possible to construct
out of <i>it</i> the idea of Space with its three dimensions, of the
action of bodies on each other, with the properties of extension, impenetrability,
cohesion, shape, hardness, softness, rest, and motion&mdash;in
short, the foundations of the objective world. This is only possible
through Space, Time, and Causality ... being preformed in the
Intellect itself,... from whence it again follows that the perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
of the external world is essentially an intellectual process, a work of the
Understanding, <i>to which sensation furnishes merely the occasion,</i> and
the data to be interpreted in each particular case."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I call this view mythological, because I am conscious of
no such Kantian machine-shop in my mind, and feel no
call to disparage the powers of poor sensation in this merciless
way. I have no introspective experience of mentally
producing or creating space. My space-intuitions occur
not in two times but in one. There is not one moment of
passive inextensive sensation, succeeded by another of active
extensive perception, but the form I see is as immediately
felt as the color which fills it out. That the higher
parts of the mind come in, who can deny? They add and
subtract, they compare and measure, they reproduce and
abstract. They inweave the space-sensations with intellectual
relations; but <i>these</i> relations are the same when they
obtain between the elements of the space-system as when
they obtain between any of the other elements of which the
world is made.</p>

<p>The essence of the Kantian contention is that there are
not <i>spaces</i>, but <i>Space</i>&mdash;one infinite continuous <i>Unit</i>&mdash;and
that our knowledge of <i>this</i> cannot be a piecemeal sensational
affair, produced by summation and abstraction. To
which the obvious reply is that, if any known thing bears
on its front the <i>appearance</i> of piecemeal construction and
abstraction, it is this very notion of the infinite unitary
space of the world. It is a <i>notion</i>, if ever there was one;
and no intuition. Most of us apprehend it in the barest
symbolic abridgment: and if perchance we ever do try to
make it more adequate, we just add one image of sensible
extension to another until we are tired. Most of us are
obliged to turn round and drop the thought of the space in
front of us when we think of that behind. And the space
represented as near to us seems more minutely subdivisible
than that we think of as lying far away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other prominent German writers on space are also
'psychical stimulists.' Herbart, whose influence has been
widest, says 'the resting eye sees no space,'<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and ascribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
visual extension to the influence of movements combining
with the non-spatial retinal feelings so as to form gradated
series of the latter. A given sensation of such a series
reproduces the idea of its associates in regular order, and
its idea is similarly reproduced by any one of them with
the order reversed. Out of the fusion of these two contrasted
reproductions comes the form of space<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>&mdash;Heaven
knows how.</p>

<p>The obvious objection is that mere serial order is a <i>genus</i>,
and space-order a very peculiar species of that <i>genus</i>; and
that, if the terms of reversible series became by that fact
coexistent terms in space, the musical scale, the degrees of
warmth and cold, and all other ideally graded series ought
to appear to us in the shape of extended corporeal aggregates,&mdash;which
they notoriously do not, though we may of
course <i>symbolize</i> their order by a spatial scheme. W.
Volkmann von Volkmar, the Herbartian, takes the bull here
by the horns, and says the musical scale <i>is</i> spatially extended,
though he admits that its space does not belong to
the real world.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> I am unacquainted with any other Herbartian
so bold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To Lotze we owe the much-used term 'local sign.' He
insisted that space could not emigrate directly into the
mind from without, but must be <i>reconstructed</i> by the soul;
and he seemed to think that the first reconstructions of it
by the soul must be super-sensational. But why sensations
themselves might not be the soul's <i>original</i> spatial reconstructive
acts Lotze fails to explain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wundt has all his life devoted himself to the elaboration
of a space-theory, of which the neatest and most final expression
is to be found in his Logik (ii. 457-60). He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the eye, space-perception has certain constant peculiarities
which prove that no single optical sensation by itself possesses the extensive
form, but that everywhere in our perception of space heterogeneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
feelings combine. If we simply suppose that luminous sensations
<i>per se</i> feel extensive, our supposition is shattered by that influence of
movement in vision which is so clearly to be traced in many normal
errors in the measurement of the field of view. If we assume, on the
other hand, that the movements and their feelings are alone possessed
of the extensive quality, we make an unjustified hypothesis, for the
phenomena compel us, it is true, to accord an influence to movement,
but give us no right to call the retinal sensations indifferent, for there
are no visual ideas without retinal sensations. If then we wish rigorously
to express the given facts, we can ascribe a spatial constitution
only to <i>combinations</i> of retinal sensations with those of movement."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus Wundt, dividing theories into 'nativistic' and
'genetic,' calls his own a genetic theory. To distinguish it
from other theories of the same class, he names it a 'theory
of complex local signs.'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It supposes two systems of local signs, whose relations&mdash;taking the
eye as an example&mdash;we may think as ... the measuring of the manifold
local-sign system of the retina by the simple local-sign system of
the movements. In its psychological nature this is a process of associative
synthesis: it consists in the fusion of both groups of sensations
into a product, whose elementary components are no longer separable
from each other in idea. In melting wholly away into the product
which they create they become consciously undistinguishable, and the
mind apprehends only their resultant, the intuition of space. Thus
there obtains a certain analogy between this psychic synthesis and that
chemical synthesis which out of simple bodies generates a compound
that appears to our immediate perception as a homogeneous whole with
new properties."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now let no modest reader think that if this sounds obscure
to him it is because he does not know the full context;
and that if a wise professor like Wundt can talk so
fluently and plausibly about 'combination' and 'psychic
synthesis,' it must surely be because those words convey a
so much greater fulness of positive meaning to the scholarly
than to the unlearned mind. Really it is quite the reverse;
<i>all</i> the virtue of the phrase lies in its mere sound
and skin. Learning does but make one the more sensible of
its inward unintelligibility. Wundt's 'theory' is the flimsiest
thing in the world. It starts by an untrue assumption,
and then corrects it by an unmeaning phrase. Retinal
sensations <i>are</i> spatial; and were they not, no amount of
'synthesis' with equally spaceless motor sensations could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
intelligibly make them so. Wundt's theory is, in short,
but an avowal of impotence, and an appeal to the inscrutable
powers of the soul.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> It confesses that we cannot
analyze the constitution or give the genesis of the spatial
quality in consciousness. But at the same time it says the
<i>antecedents</i> thereof are psychical and not cerebral facts.
In calling the quality in question a <i>sensational</i> quality, our
own account equally disclaimed ability to analyze it, but
said its antecedents were cerebral, not psychical&mdash;in other
words, that it was a <i>first</i> psychical thing. This is merely
a question of probable fact, which the reader may decide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now what shall be said of Helmholtz? Can I find
fault with a book which, on the whole, I imagine to be one
of the four or five greatest monuments of human genius in
the scientific line? If truth impels I must fain try, and
take the risks. It seems to me that Helmholtz's genius
moves most securely when it keeps close to particular facts.
At any rate, it shows least strong in purely speculative
passages, which in the Optics, in spite of many beauties,
seem to me fundamentally vacillating and obscure. The
'empiristic' view which Helmholtz defends is that the
space-determinations we perceive are in every case products
of a process of unconscious inference.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The inference
is similar to one from induction or analogy.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> We always
see that form before us which <i>habitually</i> would have
caused the sensation we now have.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> But the latter sensation
can never be intrinsically spatial, or its intrinsic space-determinations
would never be overcome as they are so
often by the 'illusory' space-determinations it so often
suggests.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Since the illusory determination can be traced
to a suggestion of Experience, the 'real' one must also be
such a suggestion: so that <i>all</i> space intuitions are due solely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
to Experience.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The only psychic activity required for
this is the association of ideas.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>But how, it may be asked, can association produce a
space-quality not in the things associated? How can we
by induction or analogy infer what we do not already
generically know? Can 'suggestions of experience' reproduce
elements which no particular experience originally
contained? This is the point by which Helmholtz's 'empiristic'
theory, as a <i>theory</i>, must be judged. No theory is
worthy of the name which leaves such a point obscure.</p>

<p>Well, Helmholtz does so leave it. At one time he seems
to fall back on inscrutable powers of the soul, and to range
himself with the 'psychical stimulists.' He speaks of Kant
as having made the essential step in the matter in distinguishing
the content of experience from that form&mdash;space,
course&mdash;which is given it by the peculiar faculties
of the mind.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> But elsewhere, again,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> speaking of sensationalistic
theories which would connect spatially determinate
feelings <i>directly</i> with certain neural events, he says it
is better to assume only such simple psychic activities as
we <i>know</i> to exist, and gives the association of ideas as an
instance of what he means. Later,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> he reinforces this remark
by confessing that he does not see how any neural
process <i>can</i> give rise without antecedent experience to a
ready-made (<i>fertige</i>) perception of space. And, finally, in
a single momentous sentence, he speaks of sensations of
<i>touch</i> as if they might be the original material of our space-percepts&mdash;which
thus, from the optical point of view, 'may
be assumed as <i>given</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Of course the eye-man has a right to fall back on the
skin-man for help at a pinch. But doesn't this mean that
he is a mere eye-man and not a complete psychologist? In
other words, Helmholtz's Optics and the 'empiristic theory'
therein professed must not be understood as attempts at
answering the <i>general</i> question of how space-consciousness
enters the mind. They simply deny that it enters with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
first optical sensations.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Our own account has affirmed
stoutly that it enters <i>then</i>; but no more than Helmholtz
have we pretended to show <i>why</i>. Who calls a thing a first
sensation admits he has no theory of its production. Helmholtz,
though all the while without an articulate theory,
makes the world think he has one. He beautifully traces
the immense part which reproductive processes play in our
vision of space, and never&mdash;except in that one pitiful little
sentence about touch&mdash;does he tell us just what it is they
reproduce. He limits himself to denying that they reproduce
originals of a visual sort. And so difficult is the
subject, and so magically do catch-words work on the
popular-scientist ear, that most likely, had he written
'physiological' instead of 'nativistic,' and 'spiritualistic'
instead of 'empiristic' (which synonyms Hering suggests),
numbers of his present empirical evolutionary followers
would fail to find in his teaching anything worthy of praise.
But since he wrote otherwise, they hurrah for him as a sort
of second Locke, dealing another death-blow at the old
bugaboo of 'innate ideas.' His 'nativistic' adversary
Hering they probably imagine&mdash;Heaven save the mark!&mdash;to
be a scholastic in modern disguise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After Wundt and Helmholtz, the most important anti-sensationalist
space-philosopher in Germany is Professor
Lipps, whose deduction of space from an order of non-spatial
differences, continuous yet separate, is a wonderful
piece of subtlety and logic. And yet he has to confess that
continuous differences form in the first instance only a logical
series, which <i>need</i> not appear spatial, and that wherever
it does so appear, this must be accounted a 'fact,' due
merely 'to the nature of the soul.'<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>Lipps, and almost all the anti-sensationalist theorists
except Helmholtz, seem guilty of that confusion which Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
Shadworth Hodgson has done so much to clear away, viz.,
the confounding the analysis of an idea with the means of
its production. Lipps, for example, finds that every space
we think of can be broken up into positions, and concludes
that in some undefined way the several positions must have
pre-existed in thought before the aggregate space could
have appeared to perception. Similarly Mr. Spencer, defining
extension as an 'aggregate of relations of coexistent
position,' says "every cognition of magnitude is a cognition
of relations of position,"<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> and "no idea of extension
can arise from the simultaneous excitation" of many nerves
"unless there is a knowledge of their relative positions."<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
Just so Prof. Bain insists that the very <i>meaning</i> of space is
scope for movement,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> and that therefore distance and magnitude
<i>can</i> be no original attributes of the eye's sensibility.
Similarly because movement is analyzable into positions
occupied at successive moments by the mover, philosophers
(e.g. Schopenhauer, as quoted above) have repeatedly
denied the possibility of <i>its</i> being an immediate sensation.
We have, however, seen that it is the most immediate of all
our space-sensations. Because it can only occur in a definite
direction the impossibility of perceiving it without
perceiving its direction has been decreed&mdash;a decree which
the simplest experiment overthrows.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> It is a case of what
I have called the 'psychologist's fallacy': mere acquaintance
with space is treated as tantamount to every sort of
knowledge about it, the conditions of the latter are demanded
of the former state of mind, and all sorts of mythological
processes are brought in to help.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> As well might
one say that because the world consists of all its parts, therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
we can only apprehend it at all by having unconsciously
summed these up in our head. It is the old idea of our
actual knowledge being drawn out from a pre-existent
potentiality, an idea which, whatever worth it may metaphysically
possess, does no good in psychology.</p>

<p>My own sensationalistic account has derived most aid
and comfort from the writings of Hering, A. W. Volkmann,
Stumpf, Le Conte, and Schön. All these authors allow
ample scope to that Experience which Berkeley's genius
saw to be a present factor in all our visual acts. But they
give Experience some grist to grind, which the <i>soi-distant</i>
'empiristic' school forgets to do. Stumpf seems to me the
most philosophical and profound of all these writers; and
I owe him much. I should doubtless have owed almost as
much to Mr. James Ward, had his article on Psychology in
the Encyclopædia Britannica appeared before my own
thoughts were written down. The literature of the question
is in all languages very voluminous. I content myself with
referring to the bibliography in Helmholtz's and Aubert's
works on Physiological Optics for the visual part of the
subject, and with naming in a note the ablest works in the
English tongue which have treated of the subject in a <i>general</i>
way.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

the skin gets from the larger one. Cf. Jastrow: Mind, xi. 546-7; American

the semi-circular canals, gives a different explanation of the organic seat of
these feelings. They are probably highly composite. With me, actual movements
in the eyes play a considerable part in them, though I am hardly conscious
of the peculiar feelings in the scalp which Fechner goes on to describe
thus: "The feeling of strained attention in the different sense-organs
seems to be only a muscular one produced in using these various organs
by setting in motion, by a sort of reflex action, the set of muscles which
belong to them. One can ask, then, with what particular muscular contraction
the sense of strained attention in the effort to recall something is
associated? On this question my own feeling gives me a decided answer;
it comes to me distinctly not as a sensation of tension in the inside of the
head, but as a feeling of strain and contraction in the scalp, with a pressure
from outwards in over the whole cranium, undoubtedly caused by a contraction
of the muscles of the scalp. This harmonizes very well with the
expressions, <i>sich den Kopf zerbrechen, den Kopf zusammennehmen</i>. In a
former illness, when I could not endure the slightest effort after continuous
thought, and had no theoretical bias on this question, the muscles of the
scalp, especially those of the back-head, assumed a fairly morbid degree of
sensibility whenever I tried to think." (Elem. der Psychophysik, ii,
490-91.)</p></div>

retinal tract be excited, first by a series of points, and next by the two
extreme points, with the interval between them unexcited, this interval will
seem considerably less in the second case than it seemed in the first. In
the skin the unexcited interval feels the larger. The reader may easily
verify the facts in this case by taking a visiting-card, cutting one edge of
it into a saw-tooth pattern, and from the opposite edge cutting out all but
the two corners, and then comparing the feelings aroused by the two edges
when held against the skin.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_153_153" id="Footnote_153_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153_153"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> It is worth while at this point to call attention with some emphasis to
the fact that, though the anatomical condition of the feeling <i>resembles</i> the
feeling itself, such resemblance cannot be taken by our understanding to
explain <i>why</i> the feeling should be just what it is. We hear it untiringly
reiterated by materialists and spiritualists alike that we can see no possible
inward reason why a certain brain-process should produce the feeling of
redness and another of anger: the one process is no more red than the
other is angry, and the coupling of process and feeling is, as far as our
understanding goes, a juxtaposition pure and simple. But in the matter of
<i>spatial</i> feeling, where the retinal patch that produces a triangle in the mind
is itself a triangle, etc., it looks at first sight as if the sensation might be a
direct cognition of its own neural condition. Were this true, however, our
sensation should be one of <i>multitude</i> rather than of continuous extent; for
the condition is <i>number</i> of optical nerve-termini, and even this is only a
remote condition and not an immediate condition. The immediate condition
of the feeling is not the process in the retina, but the process in the
brain; and the process in the brain may, for aught we know, be as unlike
a triangle,&mdash;nay, it probably is so,&mdash;as it is unlike redness or rage. It is
simply a <i>coincidence</i> that in the case of space one of the organic conditions,
viz., the triangle impressed on the skin or the retina, should lead to a representation
in the mind of the subject observed similar to that which it
produces in the psychological observer. In no other kind of case is the
coincidence found. Even should we admit that we cognize triangles in
space because of our immediate cognition of the triangular shape of our
excited group of nerve-tips, the matter would hardly be more transparent,
for the mystery would still remain, why are we so much better cognizant
of triangles on our finger-tips than on the nerve-tips of our back, on our
eye than on our ear, and on any of these parts than in our brain? Thos.
Brown very rightly rejects the notion of explaining the shape of the space
perceived by the shape of the 'nervous expansion affected.' "If this
alone were necessary, we should have square inches and half inches, and
various other forms, rectilinear and curvilinear, of fragrance and sound."

After pointing out that two opposite spherical triangles, two gloves of a
pair, two spirals wound in contrary directions, have identical inward determinations,
that is, have their parts defined with relation <i>to each other</i> by
the same law, and so must be <i>conceived</i> as identical, he showed that the impossibility
of their mutual superposition obliges us to assign to each figure
of a symmetrical pair a peculiar difference of its own which can only consist
in an <i>outward</i> determination or relation of its parts, no longer to each
other, but to the whole of an objectively outlying space with its points of the
compass given absolutely. This in<i>con</i>ceivable difference is perceived only
"through the relation to right and left, which is a matter of immediate
intuition." In these last words (<i>welches unmittelbar auf Anschauung geht</i>&mdash;Prolegomena,
§ 12) Kant expresses all that we have meant by speaking
of up and down, right and left, as <i>sensations</i>. He is wrong, however, in
invoking relation to extrinsic total space as essential to the existence of
these contrasts in figures. Relation to our own body is enough.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_157_157" id="Footnote_157_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_157_157"><span class="label">[157]</span></a> In the eyes of many it will have seemed strange to call a relation a
mere line, and a line a mere sensation. We may easily learn a great deal
<i>about</i> any relation, say that between two points: we may divide the line
which joins these, and distinguish it, and classify it, and find out <i>its</i> relations
by drawing or representing new lines, and so on. But all this
further industry has naught to do with our <i>acquaintance</i> with the relation
itself, in its first intention. So cognized, the relation <i>is</i> the line and nothing
more. It would indeed be fair to call it something less; and in fact it is
easy to understand how most of us come to feel as if the line were a much
grosser thing than the relation. The line is broad or narrow, blue or red,
made by this object or by that alternately, in the course of our experience;
it is therefore independent of any one of these accidents; and so, from
viewing it as no one of <i>such</i> sensible qualities, we may end by thinking of
it as something which cannot be defined except as the negation of all sensible
quality whatever, and which needs to be put <i>into</i> the sensations by a
mysterious act of 'relating thought.'
</p>
<p>
Another reason why we get to feel as if a space-relation must be something
other than the mere feeling of a line or angle is that between two
positions we can potentially make any number of lines and angles, or find,
to suit our purposes, endlessly numerous relations. The sense of this indefinite
potentiality cleaves to our words when we speak in a general way of
'relations of place,' and misleads us into supposing that not even any
single one of them can be exhaustively equated by a single angle or a
single line.</p></div>

as yet but little, and that little need not here be discussed. Two principal
hypotheses have been invoked in the case of the retina. Wundt (Menschen- u.
Thierseele, i. 214) called attention to the changes of color-sensibility
which the retina displays as the image of the colored object passes from the
fovea to the periphery. The color alters and becomes darker, and the
change is more rapid in certain directions than in others. This alteration
in general, however, is one of which, <i>as such</i>, we are wholly unconscious.
We see the sky as bright blue all over, the modifications of the blue sensation
being interpreted by us, not as differences in the objective color, but
as distinctions in its locality. Lotze (Medizinische Psychologie, 333, 355), on
the other hand, has pointed out the peculiar tendency which each particular
point of the retina has to call forth that movement of the eyeball which
will carry the image of the exciting object from the point in question to
the <i>fovea</i>. With each separate tendency to movement (as with each actual
movement) we may suppose a peculiar modification of sensibility to be
conjoined. This modification would constitute the peculiar local tingeing
of the image by each point. See also Sully's Psychology, pp. 118-121.
Prof. B. Erdman has quite lately (Vierteljahrsschrift f. wiss. Phil., x.
324-9) denied the existence of all evidence for such immanent <i>qualia</i> of
feeling characterizing each locality. Acute as his remarks are, they quite
fail to convince me. On the skin the <i>qualia</i> are evident, I should say.
Where, as on the retina, they are less so (Kries and Auerbach), this may
well be a mere difficulty of discrimination not yet educated to the
analysis.</p></div>

as this of local signs with each other, rather than to their qualitative
similarity in neighboring parts (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>); though it is conceivable
that association and similarity itself should here have one and the same
neural basis. If we suppose the sensory nerves from those parts of the
body beneath any patch of skin to terminate in the same sensorial brain-tract
as those from the skin itself, and if the excitement of any one fibre
tends to irradiate through the whole of that tract, the feelings of all fibres
going to that tract would presumably both have a similar intrinsic quality,
and at the same time tend each to arouse the other. Since the same nerve-trunk
in most cases supplies the skin and the parts beneath, the anatomical
hypothesis presents nothing improbable.</p></div>

sensibility is often less than that of the outside, usually rises very prominently
into consciousness when the latter is touched. Its <i>æsthetic</i> sensibility
to contact is a good deal finer. We enjoy stroking it from the extensor
to the flexor surface around the ulnar side more than in the reverse
direction. Pronating movements give rise to contacts in this order, and
are frequently indulged in when the back of the forearm feels an object
against it.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_167_167" id="Footnote_167_167"></a><a href="#FNanchor_167_167"><span class="label">[167]</span></a> So far all has been plain sailing, but our course begins to be so tortuous
when we descend into minuter detail that I will treat of the more precise
determination of locality in a long note. When <i>P</i> recalls an ideal line
leading to the fovea the line is felt in its entirety and but vaguely; whilst
<i>P</i>, which we supposed to be a single star of actual light, stands out in strong
distinction from it. The ground of the distinction between <i>P</i> and the
ideal line which it terminates is manifest&mdash;<i>P</i> being vivid while the line is
faint; <i>but why should P hold the particular position it does, at the end of the
line, rather than anywhere else&mdash;for example, in its middle?</i> That seems
something not at all manifest.
</p>
<p>
To clear up our thoughts about this latter mystery, let us take the case
of an actual line of light, none of whose parts is ideal. The feeling of
the line is produced, as we know, when a multitude of retinal points are
excited together, each of which <i>when excited separately</i> would give rise to
<i>one</i> of the feelings called local signs. Each of these signs is the feeling of
a small space. From their simultaneous arousal we might well suppose a
feeling of larger space to result. But why is it necessary that <i>in</i> this
larger spaciousness the sign <i>a</i> should appear always at one end of the line,
<i>z</i> at the other, and <i>m</i> in the middle? For though the line be a unitary
streak of light, its several constituent points can nevertheless break out
from it, and become alive, each for itself, under the selective eye of attention.
</p>
<p>
The uncritical reader, giving his first careless glance at the subject, will
say that there is no mystery in this, and that 'of course' local signs must
appear alongside of each other, each in its own place;&mdash;there is no other
way possible. But the more philosophic student, whose business it is to
discover difficulties quite as much as to get rid of them, will reflect that it
is conceivable that the partial factors might fuse into a larger space, and
yet not each be located within it any more than a voice is <i>located</i> in a
chorus. He will wonder how, after combining into the line, the points
<i>can</i> become severally alive again: the separate puffs of a 'sirene' no longer
strike the ear after they have fused into a certain pitch of sound. He will
recall the fact that when, after looking at things with one eye closed, we
double, by opening the other eye, the number of retinal points affected,
the new retinal sensations do not as a rule appear <i>alongside</i> of the
old ones and additional to them, but merely make the old ones seem
larger and nearer. Why should the affection of new points on the <i>same</i>
retina have so different a result? In fact, he will see no sort of logical
connection between (1) the original separate local signs, (2) the line as a
unit, (3) the line with the points discriminated in it, and (4) the various
nerve-processes which subserve all these different things. He will suspect
our local sign of being a very slippery and ambiguous sort of creature.
Positionless at first, it no sooner appears in the midst of a gang of companions
than it is found maintaining the strictest position of its own, and assigning
place to each of its associates. How is this possible? Must we
accept what we rejected a while ago as absurd, and admit the points each
to have position <i>in se</i>? Or must we suspect that our whole construction
has been fallacious, and that we have tried to conjure up, out of association,
qualities which the associates never contained?
</p>
<p>
There is no doubt a real difficulty here; and the shortest way of dealing
with it would be to confess it insoluble and ultimate. Even if position be
not an intrinsic character of any one of those sensations we have called
local signs, we must still admit that there is <i>something about</i> every one of
them that stands for the potentiality of position, and is the <i>ground</i> why the
local sign, when it gets placed at all, gets placed <i>here</i> rather than <i>there</i>. If this
'something' be interpreted as a physiological something, as a mere nerve-process,
it is easy to say in a blank way that when it is excited alone, it is
an 'ultimate fact' (1) that a positionless spot will appear; that when it is
excited together with other similar processes, but <i>without</i> the process of
discriminative attention, it is another 'ultimate fact' (2) that a unitary line
will come; and that the final 'ultimate fact' (3) is that, when the nerve-process
is excited <i>in combination with</i> that other process which subserves
the feeling of attention, what results will be the line with the local sign
inside of it determined to a particular place. Thus we should escape the
responsibility of explaining, by falling back on the everlasting inscrutability
of the psycho-neural nexus. The moment we call the ground of localization
physiological, we need only point out <i>how</i>, in those cases in
which localization occurs, the physiological process <i>differs</i> from those in
which it does not, to have done all we can possibly do in the matter. This
would be unexceptionable logic, and with it we might let the matter drop,
satisfied that there was no self-contradiction in it, but only the universal
psychological puzzle of how a new mode of consciousness emerges whenever
a fundamentally new mode of nervous action occurs.

But, blameless as such tactics would logically be on our part, let us see
whether we cannot push our theoretic insight a little farther. It seems to
me we can. We cannot, it is true, give a reason why the line we feel when
process (2) awakens should have its own peculiar shape; nor can we explain
the essence of the process of discriminative attention. But we can see
why, if the brute facts be admitted that a line may have one of its parts
singled out by attention at all, and that that part may appear in relation to
other parts at all, the relation must be <i>in the line itself</i>,&mdash;for the line and
the parts are the only things supposed to be in consciousness. And we can
furthermore suggest a reason why parts appearing thus in relation to each
other in a line should fall into an immutable order, and each within that
order keep its characteristic place.
</p>
<p>
If a lot of such local signs all have any quality which evenly augments
as we pass from one to the other, we can arrange them in an ideal serial
order, in which any one local sign must lie below those with more, above
those with less, of the quality in question. It must divide the series into
two parts,&mdash;unless indeed it have a maximum or minimum of the quality,
when it either begins or ends it.
</p>
<p>
Such an ideal series of local signs in the mind is, however, not yet identical
with the feeling of a line in space. Touch a dozen points on the skin
<i>successively</i>, and there seems no necessary reason why the notion of a definite
line should emerge, even though we be strongly aware of a gradation
of quality among the touches. We may of course symbolically arrange
them in a line in our thought, but we can always distinguish between a
line symbolically thought and a line directly felt.
</p>
<p>
But note now the peculiarity of the nerve-processes of all these local
signs: though they may give no line when excited successively, when excited
<i>together</i> they do give the actual sensation of a line in space. The
sum of them is the neural process of that line; the sum of their feelings
is the feeling of that line; and if we begin to single out particular points
from the line, and notice them by their rank, it is impossible to see how
this rank can <i>appear</i> except as an actual fixed space-position sensibly felt
as a bit of the total line. The scale itself appearing as a line, rank in it
must appear as a definite part of the line. If the seven notes of an octave,
when heard together, appeared to the sense of hearing as an outspread
<i>line</i> of sound&mdash;which it is needless to say they do not&mdash;why then no one
note could be discriminated without being localized, according to its pitch,
<i>in</i> the line, either as one of its extremities or as some part between.
</p>
<p>
But not alone the gradation of their quality arranges the local-sign
feelings in a scale. Our <i>movements</i> arrange them also in a time-scale.
Whenever a stimulus passes from point <i>a</i> of the skin or retina to point <i>f</i>,
it awakens the local-sign feelings in the perfectly definite time-order <i>abcdef</i>.
It cannot excite <i>f</i> until <i>cde</i> have been successively aroused. The feeling <i>c</i>
sometimes is preceded by <i>ab</i>, sometimes followed by <i>ba</i>, according to the
movement's direction; the result of it all being that we never feel either <i>a,
c,</i> or <i>f</i>, without there clinging to it faint reverberations of the various time-orders
of transition in which, throughout past experience, it has been
aroused. To the local sign <i>a</i> there clings the tinge or tone, the penumbra
or fringe, of the transition <i>bcd</i>. To <i>f</i>, to <i>c</i>, there cling quite different tones.
Once admit the principle that a feeling may be tinged by the reproductive
consciousness of an habitual transition, even when the transition is not
made, and it seems entirely natural to admit that, if the transition be habitually
in the order <i>abcdef</i>, and if <i>a, c,</i> and <i>f</i> be felt separately at all, <i>a</i> will
be felt with an essential <i>earliness</i>, <i>f</i> with an essential <i>lateness</i>, and that <i>c</i> will
fall between. Thus those psychologists who set little store by local signs
and great store by movements in explaining space-perception, would have
a perfectly definite time-order, due to motion, by which to account for
the definite order of positions that appears when sensitive spots are excited
all at once. Without, however, the preliminary admission of the 'ultimate
fact' that this collective excitement shall feel like a <i>line</i> and nothing
else, it can never be explained why the new order should needs be an
order of <i>positions</i>, and not of merely ideal serial rank. We shall hereafter
have any amount of opportunity to observe how thoroughgoing is the participation
of motion in all our spatial measurements. Whether the local
signs have their respective qualities evenly graduated or not, the feelings
of transition must be set down as among the <i>veræ causæ</i> in localization.
But the gradation of the local signs is hardly to be doubted; so we may believe
ourselves really to possess two sets of reasons for localizing any point
we may happen to distinguish from out the midst of any line or any larger
space.</p></div>

them locally different as soon as their sensations differ enough for us to

of bitter flavors to the back and of acids to the front edge of the organ.
Spices likewise affect its sides and front, and a taste like that of alum
localizes itself, by its styptic effect on the portion of mucous membrane,
which it immediately touches, more sharply than roast pork, for example,
which stimulates all parts alike. The pork, therefore, tastes more spacious
than the alum or the pepper. In the nose, too, certain smells, of which
vinegar may be taken as the type, seem less spatially extended than heavy,
suffocating odors, like musk. The reason of this appears to be that the
former inhibit inspiration by their sharpness, whilst the latter are drawn
into the lungs, and thus excite an objectively larger surface. The ascription
of height and depth to certain notes seems due, not to any localization
of the sounds, but to the fact that a feeling of vibration in the chest and
tension in the gullet accompanies the singing of a bass note, whilst, when
we sing high, the palatine mucous membrane is drawn upon by the muscles
which move the larynx, and awakens a feeling in the roof of the mouth.
</p>
<p>
The only real objection to the law of partial stimulation laid down in
the text is one that might be drawn from the organ of hearing; for, according
to modern theories, the cochlea may have its separate nerve-termini
exclusively excited by sounds of differing pitch, and yet the sounds seem
all to fill a common space, and not necessarily to be arranged alongside of
each other. At most the high note is felt as a thinner, brighter streak
against a darker background. In an article on Space, published in the
Journal of Speculative Philosophy for January, 1879, I ventured to suggest
that possibly the auditory nerve termini might be "excited all at once by
sounds of any pitch, as the whole retina would be by every luminous point
if there were no dioptric apparatus affixed." And I added: "Notwithstanding
the brilliant conjectures of the last few years which assign different
acoustic end-organs to different rates of air-wave, we are still greatly
in the dark about the subject; and I, for my part, would much more confidently
reject a theory of hearing which violated the principles advanced in
this article than give up those principles for the sake of any hypothesis
hitherto published about either organs of Corti or basilar membrane."
Professor Rutherford's theory of hearing, advanced at the meeting of the
British Association for 1886, already furnishes an alternative view which
would make hearing present no exception to the space-theory I defend
and which, whether destined to be proved true or false, ought, at any rate
to make us feel that the Helmholtzian theory is probably not the last word
in the physiology of hearing. Stepano, ff. (Hermann und Schwalbe's Jahresbericht,
xv. 404, Literature 1886) reports a case in which more than the
upper half of one cochlea was lost without any such deafness to deep notes
on that side as Helmholtz's theory would require.</p></div>

what difference it made in the discrimination of two points to have them
alike or unlike. The points chosen were (1) two large needle-heads, (2)
two screw-heads, and (3) a needle-head and a screw-head. The distance
of the screw-heads was measured from their centres. I found that when
the points gave diverse qualities of feeling (as in 3), this facilitated the
discrimination, but much less strongly than I expected. The difference,
in fact, would often not be perceptible twenty times running. When,
however, one of the points was endowed with a rotary movement, the
other remaining still, the doubleness of the points became much more evident
than before. To observe this I took an ordinary pair of compasses with
one point blunt, and the movable leg replaced by a metallic rod which could,
at any moment, be made to rotate <i>in situ</i> by a dentist's drilling-machine, to
which it was attached. The compass had then its points applied to the skin
at such a distance apart as to be felt as one impression. Suddenly rotating
the drill-apparatus then almost always made them seem as two.</p></div>

In the left-hand figure let the dark spot B move, for example, from
right to left. At the outset there is the simultaneous contrast of black and
white in B and A. When the motion has occurred so that the right-hand
figure is produced, the same contrast remains, the black and the white
having changed places. But in addition to it there is a double successive
contrast, first in A, which, a moment ago white, has now become
black; and second in B, which, a moment ago black, has now become
white. If we make each single feeling of contrast = 1 (a supposition far
too favorable to the state of rest), the sum of contrasts in the case of motion
will be 3, as against 1 in the state of rest. That is, our attention will be
called by a treble force to the difference of color, provided the color begin
to move.&mdash;(Cf. also Fleischl, Physiologische Optische Notizen, 2te

l'Espace Tactile' in the Revue Philosophique for 1888, endeavors to prove
that surfaces alone give no perception of extent, by citing the way in
which the blind go to work to gain an idea of an object's shape. If surfaces
were the percipient organ, he says, "both the seeing and the blind ought
to gain an exact idea of the size (and shape) of an object by merely laying
their hand flat upon it (provided of course that it were smaller than the
hand), and this because of their direct appreciation of the amount of tactile
surface affected, and with no recourse to the muscular sense.... But the
fact is that a person born blind never proceeds in this way to measure objective
surfaces. The only means which he has of getting at the size of a
body is that of running his finger along the lines by which it is bounded.
For instance, if you put into the hands of one born blind a book whose
dimensions are unknown to him, he will begin by resting it against his
chest so as to hold it horizontal; then, bringing his two hands together at
the middle of the edge opposite to the one against his body, he will draw
them asunder till they reach the ends of the edge in question; and then,
and not till then, will he be able to say what the length of the object is"
(vol. xxv. p. 148). I think that anyone who will try to appreciate the size
and shape of an object by simply 'laying his hand flat upon it' will find
that the great obstacle is that he <i>feels the contours</i> so imperfectly. The
moment, however, the hands move, the contours are emphatically and distinctly
felt. All perception of shape and size is perception of contours, and
first of all these must be made <i>sharp</i>. Motion does this; and the impulse
to move our organs in perception is primarily due to the craving which we
feel to get our surface-sensations sharp. When it comes to the naming and
measuring of objects in terms of some common standard we shall see presently
how movements help also; but no more in this case than the other
do they help, because the quality of extension itself is contributed by the
'muscular sense.'</p></div>

for measuring the sensibility of the skin. Two compasses are used, one on
the part A, another on the part B, of the surface. The points on B must
be adjusted so that their distance apart appears equal to that between the
points on A. With the place A constant, the second pair of points must be
varied a great deal for every change in the place B, though for the same A
and B the relation of the two compasses is remarkably constant, and continues
unaltered for months, provided but few experiments are made on
each day. If, however, we practise daily their difference grows less, in

conclusion (Am. Journal of Psychology, iii. 53): "The space-perceptions
of disparate senses are themselves disparate, and whatever harmony
there is amongst them we are warranted in regarding as the result
of experience. The spacial notions of one deprived of the sense of sight
and reduced to the use of the other space-senses must indeed be different
from our own." But he continues: "The existence of the striking
disparities between our visual and our other space-perceptions without
confusing us, and, indeed, without usually being noticed, can only be
explained by the tendency to interpret all dimensions <i>into their visual
equivalents</i>." But this author gives no reasons for saying 'visual' rather
than 'tactile;' and I must continue to think that probabilities point the
other way so far as what we call real magnitudes are concerned.</p></div>

attention, and it locates them together. But the felt object's size is the

is often made a pretext for denying to the primitive bodily feelings any
spatial quality at all. Nothing is commoner than to hear it said: "Babies
have originally no spatial perception; for when a baby's toe aches he does
not place the pain in the toe. He makes no definite movements of defence,
and may be vaccinated without being held." The facts are true enough;
but the interpretation is all wrong. What really happens is that <i>the baby
does not place his 'toe' in the pain</i>; for he knows nothing of his 'toe' as
yet. He has not attended to it as a visual object; he has not handled it
with his fingers; nor have its normal organic sensations or contacts yet
become interesting enough to be discriminated from the whole massive
feeling of the foot, or even of the leg to which it belongs. In short, the
toe is neither a member of the babe's optical space, of his hand-movement
space, nor an independent member of his leg-and-foot space. It has actually
no mental existence yet save as this little pain-space. What wonder,
then, if the pain seem a little space-world all by itself? But let the pain
once associate itself with these other space-worlds, and its space will become
part of their space. Let the baby feel the nurse stroking the
limb and awakening the pain every time her finger passes towards the
toe; let him look on and see her finger on the toe every time the pain
shoots up; let him handle his foot himself and get the pain whenever
the toe comes into his fingers or his mouth; let moving the leg exacerbate
the pain,&mdash;and all is changed. The space of the pain becomes identified
with that part of each of the other spaces which gets felt when it
awakens; and by their identity with <i>it</i> these parts are identified with each
other, and grow systematically connected as members of a larger extensive
whole.</p></div>

their common vastness behind. We shall see as we go on that this generic

<p><a name="Footnote_201_201" id="Footnote_201_201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_201_201"><span class="label">[201]</span></a> Compare Lipps, Psychologische Studien (1885), p. 18, and the other
arguments given on pp. 12 to 27. The most plausible reasons <i>for</i> contractions
of the eyeball-muscles being admitted as original contributors to the
perception of extent, are those of Wundt, Physiologische Psychologie, ii.
96-100. They are drawn from certain constant errors in our estimate of
lines and angles; which, however, are susceptible, all of them, of different
interpretations (see some of them further on).&mdash;Just as my MS. goes
to the printer, Herr Münsterberg's Beiträge zur experimentellen Psychologie,
Heft 2, comes into my hands with experiments on the measurement
of space recorded in it, which, in the author's view, prove the feeling
of muscular strain to be a principal factor in our vision of extent. As
Münsterberg worked three hours a day for a year and a half at comparing
the length of lines, seen with his eyes in different positions; and as he carefully
averaged and 'percented' 20,000 observations, his conclusion must be
listened to with great respect. Briefly it is this, that "our judgments of
size depend on a comparison of the intensity of the feelings of movement
which arise in our eyeball-muscles as we glance over the distance, and
which fuse with the sensations of light" (p. 142). The facts upon which
the conclusion is based are certain constant errors which Münsterberg
found according as the standard or given interval was to the right or the
left of the interval to be marked off as equal to it, or as it was above or
below it, or stood in some more complicated relation still. He admits that
he cannot explain all the errors in detail, and that we "stand before results
which seem surprising and not to be unravelled, because we cannot analyze
the elements which enter into the complex sensation which we receive."
But he has no doubt whatever of the general fact "that the movements of
the eyes and the sense of their position when fixed exert so decisive an
influence on our estimate of the spaces seen, that the errors cannot possibly
be explained by anything else than the movement-feelings and their
reproductions in the memory" (pp. 166, 167). It is presumptuous to doubt
a man's opinion when you haven't had his experience; and yet there are a
number of points which make me feel like suspending judgment in regard
to Herr M.'s <i>dictum</i>. He found, for example, a constant tendency to underestimate
intervals lying to the right, and to overestimate intervals lying
to the left. He ingeniously explains this as a result of the habit of <i>reading</i>,
which trains us to move our eyes easily along straight lines from left
to right, whereas in looking from right to left we move them in curved
lines across the page. As we <i>measure intervals as straight lines</i>, it costs
more muscular effort to measure from right to left than the other way,
and an interval lying to the left seems to us consequently longer than it
really is. Now I have been a reader for more years than Herr Münsterberg;
and yet with me there is a strongly pronounced error the other way.
It is the rightward-lying interval which to me seems longer than it really
is. Moreover, Herr M. wears concave spectacles, and looked through them
with his <i>head fixed</i>. May it not be that some of the errors were due to distortion
of the retinal image, as the eye looked no longer through the centre
but through the margin of the glass? In short, with all the presumptions
which we have seen against muscular contraction being definitely felt as
length, I think that there may be explanations of Herr M.'s results which
have escaped even his sagacity; and I call for a suspension of judgment
until they shall have been confirmed by other observers. I do not myself
doubt that our feeling of seen extent may be <i>altered</i> by concomitant muscular
feelings. In Chapter XVII (<a href="#Page_28">pp. 28-30</a>) we saw many examples of
similar alterations, interferences with, or exaltations of, the sensory effect
of one nerve-process by another. I do not see why currents from the
muscles or eyelids, coming in at the same time with a retinal impression,
might not make the latter seem bigger, in the same way that a greater <i>intensity</i>
in the retinal stimulation makes it seem bigger; or in the way that
a greater extent of surface excited makes the color of the surface seem
stronger, or if it be a skin-surface, makes its heat seem greater; or in the
way that the coldness of the dollar on the forehead (in Weber's old experiments)
made the dollar seem heavier. But this is a <i>physiological</i> way; and
the bigness gained is that of the retinal image after all. If I understand
Münsterberg's meaning, it is quite different from this: the bigness belongs
to the muscular feelings, as such, and is merely <i>associated</i> with those
of the retina. <i>This</i> is what I deny.</p></div>

sensation of depth is hard to discover. It seems to have nothing to do with
the parts of the retina affected, since the mere inversion of the picture (by
mirrors, reflecting prisms, etc.), without inverting the head, does not seem
to bring it about; nothing with sympathetic axial rotation of the eyes,
which might enhance the perspective through exaggerated disparity of
the two retinal images (see J. J. Müller, 'Raddrehung u. Tiefendimension,'
Leipzig Acad. Berichte, 1875, page 124), for one-eyed persons get
it as strongly as those with two eyes. I cannot find it to be connected
with any alteration in the pupil or with any ascertainable strain in the
muscles of the eye, sympathizing with those of the body. The exaggeration
of distance is even greater when we throw the head over backwards
and contract our superior recti in getting the view, than when we bend
forward and contract the inferior recti. Making the eyes diverge slightly
by weak prismatic glasses has no such effect. To me, and to all whom I
have asked to repeat the observation, the result is so marked that I do not
well understand how such an observer as Helmholtz, who has carefully
examined vision with inverted head, can have overlooked it. (See his
Phys. Optik, pp. 488, 723, 728, 772.) I cannot help thinking that anyone
who can explain the exaggeration of the depth-sensation in this case will
at the same time throw much light on its normal constitution.</p></div>

all, the problem of what is the physiological process that underlies the
distance-feeling. Since one-eyed people have it, and are inferior to the
two-eyed only in measuring its gradations, it can have no exclusive connection
with the double and disparate images produced by binocular parallax.
Since people with closed eyes, looking at an after-image, do not usually
see it draw near or recede with varying convergence, it cannot be simply
constituted by the convergence-feeling. For the same reason it would
appear non-identical with the feeling of accommodation. The differences
of apparent parallactic movement between far and near objects as
we move our head cannot constitute the distance-sensation, for such differences
may be easily reproduced experimentally (in the movements of
visible spots against a background) without engendering any illusion of perspective.
Finally, it is obvious that visible faintness, dimness, and smallness
<i>are</i> not <i>per se</i> the feeling of visible distance, however much in the
case of well-known objects they <i>may</i> serve as signs to suggest it.
</p>
<p>
A certain maximum distance-value, however, being given to the field of
view of the moment, whatever it be, the feelings that accompany the processes
just enumerated become so many <i>local signs</i> of the gradation of
distances within this maximum depth. They help us to subdivide and
measure it. Itself, however, is felt as a unit, a total distance-value, determining
the vastness of the whole field of view, which accordingly appears
as an abyss of a certain volume. And the question still persists, what
neural process is it that underlies the sense of this distance-value?
</p>
<p>
Hering, who has tried to explain the gradations within it by the interaction
of certain native distance-values belonging to each point of the two
retinæ, seems willing to admit that the <i>absolute</i> scale of the space-volume
within which the natively fixed relative distances shall appear is <i>not</i> fixed,
but determined each time by 'experience in the widest sense of the word'
(<i>Beiträge</i>, p. 344). What he calls the <i>Kernpunkt</i> of this space-volume is
the point we are momentarily fixating. The absolute scale of the whole
volume depends on the absolute distance at which this <i>Kernpunkt</i> is judged
to lie from the person of the looker. "By an alteration of the localization
of the <i>Kernpunkt</i>, the <i>inner</i> relations of the seen space are nowise altered;
this space in its totality is as a fixed unit, so to speak, displaced with respect
to the self of the looker" (p. 345). But what constitutes the localization
of the <i>Kernpunkt</i> itself at any given time, except 'Experience,' i.e.,
higher cerebral and intellectual processes, involving memory, Hering does
not seek to define.
</p>
<p>
Stumpf, the other sensationalist writer who has best realized the difficulties
of the problem, thinks that the primitive sensation of distance
must have an immediate physical antecedent, either in the shape of "an
organic alteration accompanying the process of accommodation, or else
given directly in the specific energy of the optic nerve." In contrast with
Hering, however, he thinks that it is the <i>absolute</i> distance of the spot
fixated which is thus primitively, immediately, and physiologically given,
and not the relative distances of other things about this spot. These, he
thinks, are originally seen in what, broadly speaking, may be termed one
plane with it. Whether the distance of this plane, considered as a phenomenon
of our primitive sensibility, be an invariable datum, or susceptible
of fluctuation, he does not, if I understand him rightly, undertake
dogmatically to decide, but inclines to the former view. For him then,
as for Hering, higher cerebral processes of association, under the name of
'Experience,' are the authors of fully one-half part of the distance-perceptions
which we at any given time may have.
</p>
<p>
Hering's and Stumpf's theories are reported for the English reader by
Mr. Sully (in Mind, iii. pp. 172-6). Mr. Abbott, in his Sight and Touch
(pp. 96-8), gives a theory which is to me so obscure that I only refer the
reader to its place, adding that it seems to make of distance a fixed function
of retinal sensation as modified by focal adjustment. Besides these
three authors I am ignorant of any, except Panum, who may have attempted
to define distance as in any degree an immediate sensation. And with
them the direct sensational share is reduced to a very small proportional
part, in our completed distance-judgments.
</p>
<p>
Professor Lipps, in his singularly acute Psychologische Studien (p. 69
ff.), argues, as Ferrier, in his review of Berkeley (Philosophical Remains, ii.
330 ff.), had argued before him, that it is <i>logically impossible</i> we should
perceive the distance of anything from the eye by sight; for a <i>seen</i> distance
can only be between <i>seen</i> termini; and one of the termini, in the case of distance
from the eye, is the eye itself, which is not seen. Similarly of the
distance of two points behind each other: the near one <i>hides</i> the far one,
no space is seen between them. For the space between two objects to be
<i>seen</i>, both must appear <i>beside</i> each other, then the space in question will be
<i>visible</i>. On no other condition is its visibility possible. The conclusion is
that things can properly be seen only in what Lipps calls a surface, and
that our knowledge of the third dimension must needs be conceptual, not
sensational or visually intuitive.
</p>
<p>
But no arguments in the world can prove a feeling which actually
exists to be impossible. The feeling of depth or distance, of farness or
awayness, does actually exist as a fact of our visual sensibility. All that
Professor Lipps's reasonings prove concerning it is that it is not linear in
its character, or in its immediacy fully homogeneous and consubstantial
with the feeling of literal distance between two seen termini; in short,
that there are <i>two</i> sorts of optical sensation, each inexplicably due to a
peculiar neural process. The neural process is easily discovered, in the
case of lateral extension or spreadoutness, to be the number of retinal
nerve-ends affected by the light; in the case of protension or mere farness
it is more complicated and, as we have concluded, is still to seek. The
two sensible qualities unite in the primitive visual bigness. The measurement
of their various amounts against each other obeys the general laws
of all such measurements. We discover their equivalencies by means
of objects, apply the same units to both, and translate them into each other
so habitually that at last they get to seem to us even quite similar in kind.
This final appearance of homogeneity may perhaps be facilitated by the
fact that in binocular vision two points situated on the prolongation of the
optical axis of <i>one</i> of the eyes, so that the near one hides the far one, are by
the <i>other</i> eye seen laterally apart. Each eye has in fact a foreshortened
lateral view of the other's line of sight. In The London Times for Feb. 8,
1884, is an interesting letter by J. D. Dougal, who tries to explain by this
reason why two-eyed rifle-shooting has such advantages over shooting with
one eye closed.</p></div>

like one large median glass. The faculty of seeing stereoscopic slides single
without an instrument is of the utmost utility to the student of physiological
optics, and persons with strong eyes can easily acquire it. The
only difficulty lies in dissociating the degree of accommodation from the
degree of convergence which it usually accompanies. If the right picture
is focussed by the right eye, the left by the left eye, the optic axes must
either be parallel or converge upon an imaginary point some distance
behind the plane of the pictures, according to the size and distance apart
of the pictures. The accommodation, however, has to be made for the
plane of the pictures itself, and a near accommodation with a far-off convergence
is something which the ordinary use of our eyes never teaches us
to effect.</p></div>

tries to explain this phenomenon by unconscious rotations of the eyeball.
But movements of the eyeball can only explain such appearances
of movements as are the same over the whole field. In the windowed
board one part of the field seems to move in one way, another part in another.
The same is true when we turn from the spiral to look at the wall&mdash;the
<i>centre</i> of the field alone swells out or contracts, the margin does the
reverse or remains at rest. Mach and Dvorak have beautifully proved the
impossibility of eye-rotations in this case (Sitzungsber. d. Wiener Akad.,
Bd. lxi.). See also Bowditch and Hall's paper as above, p. 300.</p></div>

'feeling of innervation' needed to move the eyeballs upwards,&mdash;a careful

greater estimate of the distance traversed. It suffices to remark, however,
with Lipps, that were the innervation all, a column of S's placed on top
of each other should look each larger than the one below it, and a weathercock
on a steeple gigantic, neither of which is the case. Only the halves
of <i>the same object</i> look different in size, because the customary correction
for foreshortening bears only on the relations of the parts of special <i>things</i>

of the apparent vertical meridians of the two retinæ, by the manner
in which an identical line drawn on the ground before us in the median
plane will throw its images on the two eyes respectively. The matter is
too technical for description here; the unlearned reader may be referred
for it to J. Le Conte's Sight in the Internat. Scient. Series, p. 198 ff. But, for
the benefit of those to whom <i>verbum sat</i>, I cannot help saying that it seems
to me that the <i>exactness</i> of the relation of the two meridians&mdash;whether divergent
or not, for their divergence differs in individuals and often in one individual
at diverse times&mdash;precludes its being due to the mere habitual
falling-off of the image of one objective line on both. Le Conte, e.g.,
measures their position down to a sixth of a degree, others to tenths. This
indicates an organic identity in the sensations of the two retinæ, which the
experience of median perspective horizontals may roughly have agreed
with, but hardly can have engendered. Wundt explains the divergence as
usual, by the <i>Innervationsgefühl</i> (<i>op. cit.</i>. ii. 99 ff.).</p></div>

plane surface by first drawing one as long as the ruler permits, and then
sliding the ruler somewhat along the drawn line and drawing again, etc.
If the ruler is exactly straight, we get in this way a straight line. If it is
somewhat curved we get a circle. Now, instead of the sliding ruler we
use in the field of sight the central spot of distinctest vision impressed with
a linear sensation of sight, which at times may be intensified till it becomes
an after-image. We follow, in looking, the direction of this line, and in
so doing we slide the line along itself and get a prolongation of its length.
On a plane surface we can carry on this procedure on any sort of a straight
or curved ruler, but in the field of vision there is for each direction and
movement of the eye only one sort of line which it is possible for us to
slide along in its own direction continually." These are what Helmholtz
calls the 'circles of direction' of the visual field&mdash;lines which he has
studied with his usual care. Cf. Physiol. Optik, p. 548 ff.</p></div>

<h4>THE PERCEPTION OF REALITY.</h4>

<h4>BELIEF.</h4>


<p>Everyone knows the difference between imagining a
thing and believing in its existence, between supposing a
proposition and acquiescing in its truth. In the case of
acquiescence or belief, the object is not only apprehended
by the mind, but is held to have reality. Belief is thus the
mental state or function of cognizing reality. As used in
the following pages, 'Belief' will mean every degree of assurance,
including the highest possible certainty and conviction.</p>

<p>There are, as we know, two ways of studying every
psychic state. First, the way of analysis: What does it
consist in? What is its inner nature? Of what sort of
mind-stuff is it composed? Second, the way of history:
What are its conditions of production, and its connection
with other facts?</p>

<p>Into the first way we cannot go very far. <i>In its inner
nature, belief, or the sense of reality, is a sort of feeling more
allied to the emotions than to anything else.</i> Mr. Bagehot distinctly
calls it the 'emotion' of conviction. I just now
spoke of it as acquiescence. It resembles more than anything
what in the psychology of volition we know as consent.
Consent is recognized by all to be a manifestation
of our active nature. It would naturally be described by
such terms as 'willingness' or the 'turning of our disposition.'
What characterizes both consent and belief is the
cessation of theoretic agitation, through the advent of an
idea which is inwardly stable, and fills the mind solidly to
the exclusion of contradictory ideas. When this is the
case, motor effects are apt to follow. Hence the states of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
consent and belief, characterized by repose on the purely
intellectual side, are both intimately connected with subsequent
practical activity. This inward stability of the mind's
content is as characteristic of disbelief as of belief. But we
shall presently see that we never disbelieve anything except
for the reason that we believe something else which
contradicts the first thing.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Disbelief is thus an incidental
complication to belief, and need not be considered by itself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The true opposites of belief,</i> psychologically considered,
<i>are doubt and inquiry, not disbelief.</i> In both these states the
content of our mind is in unrest, and the emotion engendered
thereby is, like the emotion of belief itself, perfectly
distinct, but perfectly indescribable in words. Both sorts
of emotion may be pathologically exalted. One of the
charms of drunkenness unquestionably lies in the deepening
of the sense of reality and truth which is gained therein.
In whatever light things may then appear to us, they seem
more utterly what they are, more 'utterly utter' than when
we are sober. This goes to a fully unutterable extreme
in the nitrous oxide intoxication, in which a man's very soul
will sweat with conviction, and he be all the while unable
to tell what he is convinced of at all.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The pathological
state opposed to this solidity and deepening has been called
the questioning mania (<i>Grübelsucht</i> by the Germans). It is
sometimes found as a substantive affection, paroxysmal or
chronic, and consists in the inability to rest in any conception,
and the need of having it confirmed and explained.
'Why do I stand here where I stand?' 'Why is a glass a
glass, a chair a chair?' 'How is it that men are only of
the size they are? Why not as big as houses,' etc., etc.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
There is, it is true, another pathological state which is as
far removed from doubt as from belief, and which some
may prefer to consider the proper contrary of the latter
state of mind. I refer to the feeling that everything is
hollow, unreal, dead. I shall speak of this state again
upon a later page. The point I wish to notice here is simply
that belief and disbelief are but two aspects of one
psychic state.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John Mill, reviewing various opinions about belief,
comes to the conclusion that no account of it can be given:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What," he says, "is the difference <i>to our minds</i> between thinking
of a reality and representing to ourselves an imaginary picture? I confess
I can see no escape from the opinion that the distinction is ultimate
and primordial. There is no more difficulty in holding it to be so than
in holding the difference between a sensation and an idea to be primordial.
It seems almost another aspect of the same difference.... I
cannot help thinking, therefore, that there is in the remembrance of a
real fact, as distinguished from that of a thought, an element which
does not consist... in a difference between the mere ideas which are
present to the mind in the two cases. This element, howsoever we define
it, constitutes belief, and is the difference between Memory and
Imagination. From whatever direction we approach, this difference
seems to close our path. When we arrive at it, we seem to have reached,
as it were, the central point of our intellectual nature, presupposed and
built upon in every attempt we make to explain the more recondite
phenomena of our mental being."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>If the words of Mill be taken to apply to the mere subjective
analysis of belief&mdash;to the question, What does it
feel like when we have it?&mdash;they must be held, on the whole,
to be correct. Belief, the sense of reality, feels like itself&mdash;that
is about as much as we can say.</p>

<p>Prof. Brentano, in an admirable chapter of his <i>Psychologie</i>,
expresses this by saying that conception and belief
(which he names <i>judgment</i>) are two different fundamental
psychic phenomena. What I myself have called (Vol. I, p.
275) the 'object' of thought may be comparatively simple,
like "Ha! what a pain," or "It-thunders"; or it may be
complex, like "Columbus-discovered-America-in-1492," or
"There-exists-an-all-wise-Creator-of-the-world." In either
case, however, the mere thought of the object may exist as
something quite distinct from the belief in its reality. The
belief, as Brentano says, presupposes the mere thought:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Every object comes into consciousness in a twofold way, as simply
thought of [<i>vorgestellt</i>] and as admitted [<i>anerkannt</i>] or denied. The
relation is analogous to that which is assumed by most philosophers
(by Kant no less than by Aristotle) to obtain between mere thought and
desire. Nothing is ever desired without being thought of; but the
desiring is nevertheless a second quite new and peculiar form of relation
to the object, a second quite new way of receiving it into
consciousness. No more is anything judged [i.e., believed or disbelieved]
which is not thought of too. But we must insist that, so soon as the
object of a thought becomes the object of an assenting or rejecting
judgment, our consciousness steps into an entirely new relation towards
it. It is then twice present in consciousness, as thought of, and
as held for real or denied; just as when desire awakens for it, it is both
thought and simultaneously desired." (P. 266.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The commonplace doctrine of 'judgment' is that it
consists in the combination of 'ideas' by a 'copula' into
a 'proposition,' which may be of various sorts, as affirmative,
negative, hypothetical, etc. But who does not see
that in a disbelieved or doubted or interrogative or conditional
proposition, the ideas are combined in the same
identical way in which they are in a proposition which is
solidly believed? <i>The way in which the ideas are combined is
a part of the inner constitution of the thought's object or content.</i>
That object is sometimes an articulated whole with relations
between its parts, amongst which relations, that of predicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
to subject may be one. But when we have got our object
with its inner constitution thus defined in a proposition,
then the question comes up regarding the object as a whole:
'Is it a real object? is this proposition a true proposition
or not?' And in the answer <i>Yes</i> to <i>this</i> question lies that
new psychic act which Brentano calls 'judgment,' but which
I prefer to call 'belief.'</p>

<p>In every proposition, then, so far as it is believed, questioned,
or disbelieved, four elements are to be distinguished,
the subject, the predicate, and their relation (of whatever
sort it be)&mdash;these form the <i>object</i> of belief&mdash;and finally the
psychic attitude in which our mind stands towards the
proposition taken as a whole&mdash;and this is the belief itself.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Admitting, then, that this attitude is a state of consciousness
<i>sui generis</i>, about which nothing more can be said in
the way of internal analysis, let us proceed to the second
way of studying the subject of belief: <i>Under what circumstances
do we think things real?</i> We shall soon see how much
matter this gives us to discuss.</p>


<h4>THE VARIOUS ORDERS OF REALITY.</h4>


<p>Suppose a new-born mind, entirely blank and waiting
for experience to begin. Suppose that it begins in the
form of a visual impression (whether faint or vivid is immaterial)
of a lighted candle against a dark background,
and nothing else, so that whilst this image lasts it constitutes
the entire universe known to the mind in question.
Suppose, moreover (to simplify the hypothesis), that the
candle is only imaginary, and that no 'original' of it is
recognized by us psychologists outside. Will this hallucinatory
candle be believed in, will it have a real existence
for the mind?</p>

<p>What possible sense (for that mind) would a suspicion
have that the candle was not real? What would doubt or
disbelief of it imply? When <i>we</i>, the onlooking psychologists,
say the candle is unreal, we mean something quite
definite, viz., that there is a world known to <i>us</i> which <i>is</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
real, and to which we perceive that the candle does not
belong; it belongs exclusively to that individual mind, has
no <i>status</i> anywhere else, etc. It exists, to be sure, in a
fashion, for it forms the content of that mind's hallucination;
but the hallucination itself, though unquestionably
it is a sort of existing fact, has no knowledge of <i>other</i> facts;
and since those <i>other</i> facts are the realities par <i>excellence</i> for
us, and the only things we believe in, the candle is simply
outside of our reality and belief altogether.</p>

<p>By the hypothesis, however, the <i>mind which sees the candle</i>
can spin no such considerations as these about it, for of
other facts, actual or possible, it has no inkling whatever.
That candle is its all, its absolute. Its entire faculty of
attention is absorbed by it. It <i>is</i>, it is <i>that</i>; it is <i>there</i>; no
other possible candle, or quality of this candle, no other
possible place, or possible object in the place, no alternative,
in short, suggests itself as even conceivable; so how
can the mind help believing the candle real? The supposition
that it might possibly not do so is, under the supposed
conditions, unintelligible.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>This is what Spinoza long ago announced:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let us conceive a boy," he said, "imagining to himself a horse,
and taking note of nothing else. As this imagination involves the existence
of the horse, <i>and the boy has no perception which annuls its
existence,</i> he will necessarily contemplate the horse as present, nor will
he be able to doubt of its existence, however little certain of it he may
be. I deny that a man in so far as he imagines [<i>percipit</i>] affirms nothing.
For what is it to imagine a winged horse but to affirm that, the
horse [that horse, namely] has wings? For if the mind had nothing
before it but the winged horse it would contemplate the same as present,
would have no cause to doubt of its existence, nor any power of
dissenting from its existence, unless the imagination of the winged
horse were joined to an idea which contradicted [<i>tollit</i>] its existence."
(Ethics, ii. 49, Scholium.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The sense that anything we think of is unreal can only
come, then, when that thing is contradicted by some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
thing of which we think. <i>Any object which remains uncontradicted
is ipso facto believed and posited as absolute reality.</i></p>

<p>Now, how comes it that one thing thought of can be contradicted
by another? It cannot unless it begins the quarrel
by saying something inadmissible about that other.
Take the mind with the candle, or the boy with the horse.
If either of them say, 'That candle or that horse, even when
I don't see it, exists in <i>the outer world</i>,' he pushes into 'the
outer world' an object which may be incompatible with
everything which he otherwise knows of that world. If so,
he must take his choice of which to hold by, the present
perceptions or the other knowledge of the world. If he
holds to the other knowledge, the present perceptions are
contradicted, <i>so far as their relation to that world goes.</i> Candle
and horse, whatever they may be, are not existents in
outward space. They are existents, of course; they are
mental objects; mental objects have existence as mental
objects. But they are situated in their own spaces, the
space in which they severally appear, and neither of those
spaces is the space in which the realities called 'the outer
world' exist.</p>

<p>Take again the horse with wings. If I merely dream of
a horse with wings, my horse interferes with nothing else
and has not to be contradicted. That horse, its wings, and
its place, are all equally real. That horse exists no otherwise
than as winged, and is moreover really there, for that
place exists no otherwise than as the place of that horse,
and claims as yet no connection with the other places of
the world. But if with this horse I make an inroad into
the <i>world otherwise known</i>, and say, for example, 'That is
my old mare Maggie, having grown a pair of wings where
she stands in her stall,' the whole case is altered; for now
the horse and place are identified with a horse and place
otherwise known, and <i>what</i> is known of the latter objects is
incompatible with what is perceived with the former.
'Maggie in her stall with wings! Never!' The wings are
unreal, then, visionary. I have dreamed a lie about Maggie
in her stall.</p>

<p>The reader will recognize in these two cases the two
sorts of judgment called in the logic-books existential and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
attributive respectively. The candle exists as an outer
reality' is an existential, 'My Maggie has got a pair of
wings' is an attributive, proposition;<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> and it follows from
what was first said that <i>all propositions, whether attributive
or existential, are believed through the very fact of being conceived,
unless they clash with other propositions believed, at the
same time, by affirming that their terms are the same with the
terms of these other propositions.</i> A dream-candle has existence,
true enough; but not the same existence (existence
for itself, namely, or <i>extra mentem meam</i>) which the candles
of waking perception have. A dream-horse has wings; but
then neither horse nor wings are the same with any horses
or wings known to memory. That we can at any moment
think of the same thing which at any former moment we
thought of is the ultimate law of our intellectual constitution.
But when we now think of it incompatibly with our
other ways of thinking it, then we must choose which way
to stand by, for we cannot continue to think in two contradictory
ways at once. <i>The whole distinction of real and unreal,
the whole psychology of belief, disbelief, and doubt, is thus
grounded on two mental facts&mdash;first, that we are liable to think
differently of the same; and second, that when we have done so,
we can choose which way of thinking to adhere to and which to
disregard.</i></p>

<p>The subjects adhered to become real subjects, the attributes
adhered to real attributes, the existence adhered
to real existence; whilst the subjects disregarded become
imaginary subjects, the attributes disregarded erroneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
attributes, and the existence disregarded an existence in
no man's land, in the limbo 'where footless fancies dwell.'
The real things are, in M. Taine's terminology, the <i>reductives</i>
of the things judged unreal.</p>


<h4>THE MANY WORLDS.</h4>


<p>Habitually and practically we do not <i>count</i> these disregarded
things as existents at all. For them <i>Væ victis</i> is the
law in the popular philosophy; they are not even treated as
appearances; they are treated as if they were mere waste,
equivalent to nothing at all. To the genuinely philosophic
mind, however, they still have existence, though not the
same existence, as the real things. <i>As</i> objects of fancy, <i>as</i>
errors, <i>as</i> occupants of dreamland, etc., they are in their
way as indefeasible parts of life, as undeniable features of
the Universe, as the realities are in their way. The total
world of which the philosophers must take account is thus
composed of the realities <i>plus</i> the fancies and illusions.</p>

<p>Two sub-universes, at least, connected by relations
which philosophy tries to ascertain! Really there are more
than two sub-universes of which we take account, some of
us of this one, and others of that. For there are various
categories both of illusion and of reality, and alongside of
the world of absolute error (i.e., error confined to single
individuals) but still within the world of absolute reality
(i.e., reality believed by the complete philosopher) there is
the world of collective error, there are the worlds of abstract
reality, of relative or practical reality, of ideal relations,
and there is the supernatural world. The popular mind
conceives of all these sub-worlds more or less disconnectedly;
and when dealing with one of them, forgets for
the time being its relations to the rest. The complete philosopher
is he who seeks not only to assign to every given
object of his thought its right place in one or other of these
sub-worlds, but he also seeks to determine the relation of
each sub-world to the others in the total world which <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>The most important sub-universes commonly discriminated
from each other and recognized by most of us as
existing, each with its own special and separate style of
existence, are the following:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>
<p>(1) The world of sense, or of physical 'things' as we
instinctively apprehend them, with such qualities as heat,
color, and sound, and such 'forces' as life, chemical affinity,
gravity, electricity, all existing as such within or on the
surface of the things.</p>

<p>(2) The world of science, or of physical things as the
learned conceive them, with secondary qualities and 'forces'
(in the popular sense) excluded, and nothing real but solids
and fluids and their 'laws' (i.e., customs) of motion.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>(3) The world of ideal relations, or abstract truths believed
or believable by all, and expressed in logical, mathematical,
metaphysical, ethical, or æsthetic propositions.</p>

<p>(4) The world of 'idols of the tribe,' illusions or prejudices
common to the race. All educated people recognize
these as forming one sub-universe. The motion of the sky
round the earth, for example, belongs to this world. That
motion is not a recognized item of any of the other worlds;
but as an 'idol of the tribe' it really exists. For certain
philosophers 'matter' exists only as an idol of the tribe.
For science, the 'secondary qualities' of matter are but
'idols of the tribe.'</p>

<p>(5) The various supernatural worlds, the Christian
heaven and hell, the world of the Hindoo mythology, the
world of Swedenborg's <i>visa et audita</i>, etc. Each of these is
a consistent system, with definite relations among its own
parts. Neptune's trident, e.g., has no status of reality whatever
in the Christian heaven; but within the classic Olympus
certain definite things are true of it, whether one believe
in the reality of the classic mythology as a whole or not.
The various worlds of deliberate fable may be ranked with
these worlds of faith&mdash;the world of the <i>Iliad</i>, that of <i>King
Lear</i>, of the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>
<p>(6) The various worlds of individual opinion, as numerous
as men are.</p>

<p>(7) The worlds of sheer madness and vagary, also indefinitely
numerous.</p>

<p><i>Every object we think of gets at last referred to one world or
another of this or of some similar list.</i> It settles into our belief
as a common-sense object, a scientific object, an abstract
object, a mythological object, an object of some one's mistaken
conception, or a madman's object; and it reaches
this state sometimes immediately, but often only after being
hustled and bandied about amongst other objects until
it finds some which will tolerate its presence and stand in
relations to it which nothing contradicts. The molecules
and ether-waves of the scientific world, for example, simply
kick the object's warmth and color out, they refuse to
have any relations with them. But the world of 'idols of
the tribe' stands ready to take them in. Just so the world
of classic myth takes up the winged horse; the world of
individual hallucination, the vision of the candle; the
world of abstract truth, the proposition that justice is
kingly, though no actual king be just. The various worlds
themselves, however, appear (as aforesaid) to most men's
minds in no very definitely conceived relation to each
other, and our attention, when it turns to one, is apt to
drop the others for the time being out of its account. Propositions
concerning the different worlds are made from
'different points of view'; and in this more or less chaotic
state the consciousness of most thinkers remains to the
end. Each world <i>whilst it is attended to</i> is real after its own
fashion; only the reality lapses with the attention.</p>


<h4>THE WORLD OF 'PRACTICAL REALITIES.'</h4>


<p>Each thinker, however, has dominant habits of attention;
and these <i>practically elect from among the various
worlds some one to be for him the world of ultimate realities</i>.
From this world's objects he does not appeal. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
positively contradicts them must get into another world or
die. The horse, e.g., may have wings to its heart's content,
so long as it does not pretend to be the real world's horse&mdash;<i>that</i>
horse is absolutely wingless. For most men, as we shall
immediately see, the 'things of sense' hold this prerogative
position, and are the absolutely real world's nucleus. Other
things, to be sure, may be real for this man or for that&mdash;things
of science, abstract moral relations, things of the
Christian theology, or what not. But even for the special
man, these things are usually real with a less real reality
than that of the things of sense. They are taken less
seriously; and the very utmost that can be said for anyone's
belief in them is that it is as strong as his 'belief in
his own senses.'<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>In all this the everlasting partiality of our nature shows
itself, our inveterate propensity to choice. For, in the
strict and ultimate sense of the word existence, everything
which can be thought of at all exists as <i>some</i> sort of object,
whether mythical object, individual thinker's object, or object
in outer space and for intelligence at large. Errors,
fictions, tribal beliefs, are parts of the whole great Universe
which God has made, and He must have meant all these
things to be in it, each in its respective place. But for us
finite creatures, "'tis to consider too curiously to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
so." The mere fact of appearing as an object at all is not
enough to constitute reality. That may be metaphysical
reality, reality for God; but what we need is practical
reality, reality for ourselves; and, to have that, an object
must not only appear, but it must appear both <i>interesting</i>
and <i>important</i>. The worlds whose objects are neither interesting
nor important we treat simply negatively, we
brand them as <i>un</i>real.</p>

<p><i>In the relative sense,</i> then, the sense in which we contrast
reality with simple <i>un</i>reality, and in which one thing is
said to have <i>more</i> reality than another, and to be more believed,
<i>reality means simply relation to our emotional and
active life.</i> This is the only sense which the word ever has
in the mouths of practical men. <i>In this sense, whatever excites
and stimulates our interest is real;</i> whenever an object
so appeals to us that we turn to it, accept it, fill our mind
with it, or practically take account of it, so far it is real for
us, and we believe it. Whenever, on the contrary, we
ignore it, fail to consider it or act upon it, despise it, reject
it, forget it, so far it is unreal for us and disbelieved.
Hume's account of the matter was then essentially correct,
when he said that belief in anything was simply the having
the idea of it in a lively and active manner:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I say, then, that belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible,
firm, steady conception of an object than the imagination alone is ever
able to attain.... It consists not in the peculiar nature or order of
the ideas, but in the <i>manner</i> of their conception and in their <i>feeling</i> to
the mind. I confess that it is impossible perfectly to explain this feeling
or manner of conception.... Its true and proper name... is
<i>belief</i>, which is a term that everyone sufficiently understands in common
life. And in philosophy we can go no farther than assert that belief is
something felt by the mind, which distinguishes the idea of the judgment
from the fictions of the imagination.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> It gives them more weight
and influence; makes them appear of greater importance; enforces
them in the mind; gives them a superior influence on the passions, and
renders them the governing principle in our actions."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>
<p>Or as Prof. Bain puts it: "In its essential character,
belief is a phase of our active nature&mdash;otherwise called the
Will."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The object of belief, then, reality or real existence, is
something quite different from all the other predicates which
a subject may possess. Those are properties intellectually
or sensibly intuited. When we add any one of them to the
subject, we increase the intrinsic content of the latter, we
enrich its picture in our mind. But adding reality does
not enrich the picture in any such inward way; it leaves it
inwardly as it finds it, and only fixes it and stamps it in to
<i>us</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The real," as Kant says, "contains no more than the possible. A
hundred real dollars do not contain a penny more than a hundred possible
dollars.... By whatever, and by however many, predicates I
may think a thing, nothing is added to it if I add that the thing exists....
Whatever, therefore, our concept of an object may contain, we
must always step outside of it in order to attribute to it existence."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The 'stepping outside' of it is the establishment either
of immediate practical relations between it and ourselves,
or of relations between it and other objects with which we
have immediate practical relations. Relations of this sort,
which are as yet not transcended or superseded by others,
are <i>ipso facto</i> real relations, and confer reality upon their
objective term. <i>The fons et origo of all reality, whether from</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
<i>the absolute or the practical point of view, is thus subjective, is
ourselves.</i> As bare logical thinkers, without emotional reaction,
we give reality to whatever objects we think of, for
they are really phenomena, or objects of our passing
thought, if nothing more. But, <i>as thinkers with emotional
reaction, we give what seems to us a still higher degree of
reality to whatever things we select and emphasize and turn
to</i> <span class="smcap">with a will</span>. These are our <i>living</i> realities; and not
only these, but all the other things which are intimately
connected with these. Reality, starting from our Ego,
thus sheds itself from point to point&mdash;first, upon all objects
which have an immediate sting of interest for our Ego in
them, and next, upon the objects most continuously related
with these. It only fails when the connecting thread is
lost. A whole system may be real, if it only hang to our
Ego by one immediately <i>stinging</i> term. But what contradicts
any such stinging term, even though it be another
stinging term itself, is either not believed, or only believed
after settlement of the dispute.</p>

<p>We reach thus the important conclusion that <i>our own
reality, that sense of our own life which we at every moment possess,
is the ultimate of ultimates for our belief.</i> 'As sure as I
exist!'&mdash;this is our uttermost warrant for the being of all
other things. As Descartes made the indubitable reality
of the <i>cogito</i> go bail for the reality of all that the <i>cogito</i> involved,
so we all of us, feeling our own present reality with
absolutely coercive force, ascribe an all but equal degree
of reality, first to whatever things we lay hold on with a
sense of personal need, and second, to whatever farther
things continuously belong with these. "Mein Jetzt und
Hier," as Prof. Lipps says, "ist der letzte Angelpunkt für
alle Wirklichkeit, also alle Erkenntniss."</p>

<p>The world of living realities as contrasted with unrealities
is thus anchored in the Ego, considered as an active
and emotional term.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> That is the hook from which the
rest dangles, the absolute support. And as from a painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
hook it has been said that one can only hang a painted
chain, so conversely, from a real hook only a real chain
can properly be hung. <i>Whatever things have intimate and
continuous connection with my life are things of whose reality
I cannot doubt.</i> Whatever things fail to establish this connection
are things which are practically no better for me
than if they existed not at all.</p>

<p>In certain forms of melancholic perversion of the sensibilities
and reactive powers, nothing touches us intimately,
rouses us, or wakens natural feeling. The consequence is
the complaint so often heard from melancholic patients,
that nothing is believed in by them as it used to be, and
that all sense of reality is fled from life. They are sheathed
in india-rubber; nothing penetrates to the quick or draws
blood, as it were. According to Griesinger, "I see, I hear!"
such patients say, "but the objects do not reach me, it is as
if there were a wall between me and the outer world!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In such patients there often is an alteration of the cutaneous sensibility,
such that things feel indistinct or sometimes rough and woolly.
But even were this change always present, it would not completely explain
the psychic phenomenon... which reminds us more of the alteration
in our psychic relations to the outer world which advancing age on
the one hand, and on the other emotions and passions, may bring about.
In childhood we feel ourselves to be closer to the world of sensible
phenomena, we live immediately with them and in them; an intimately
vital tie binds us and them together. But with the ripening of reflection
this tie is loosened, the warmth of our interest cools, things look
differently to us, and we act more as foreigners to the outer world, even
though we know it a great deal better. Joy and expansive emotions in
general draw it nearer to us again. Everything makes a more lively
impression, and with the quick immediate return of this warm receptivity
for sense impressions, joy makes us feel young again. In depressing
emotions it is the other way. Outer things, whether living or inorganic,
suddenly grow cold and foreign to us, and even our favorite
objects of interest feel as if they belonged to us no more. Under these
circumstances, receiving no longer from anything a lively impression,
we cease to turn towards outer things, and the sense of inward loneliness
grows upon us.... Where there is no strong intelligence to control this
<i>blasé</i> condition, this psychic coldness and lack of interest, the issue of
these states in which all seems so cold and hollow, the heart dried up,
the world grown dead and empty, is often suicide or the deeper forms
of insanity."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p></blockquote>

<h4>THE PARAMOUNT REALITY OF SENSATIONS.</h4>


<p>But now we are met by questions of detail. What does
this stirring, this exciting power, this interest, consist in,
which some objects have? which <i>are</i> those 'intimate relations'
with our life which give reality? And what things
stand in these relations immediately, and what others are
so closely connected with the former that (in Hume's language)
we 'carry our disposition' also on to them?</p>

<p>In a simple and direct way these questions cannot be
answered at all. The whole history of human thought is
but an unfinished attempt to answer them. For what have
men been trying to find out, since men were men, but just
those things: "Where do our true interests lie&mdash;which relations
shall we call the intimate and real ones&mdash;which
things shall we call living realities and which not?" A few
psychological points can, however, be made clear.</p>

<p><i>Any relation to our mind at all, in the absence of a stronger
relation, suffices to make an object real.</i> The barest appeal
to our attention is enough for that. Revert to the beginning
of the chapter, and take the candle entering the vacant
mind. The mind was waiting for just some such object to
make its spring upon. It makes its spring and the candle
is believed. But when the candle appears at the same time
with other objects, it must run the gauntlet of their rivalry,
and then it becomes a question which of the various candidates
for attention shall compel belief. As a rule we believe
as much as we can. We would believe everything if
we only could. When objects are represented by us quite
unsystematically they conflict but little with each other,
and the number of them which in this chaotic manner we
can believe is limitless. The primitive savage's mind is a
jungle in which hallucinations, dreams, superstitions, conceptions,
and sensible objects all flourish alongside of each
other, unregulated except by the attention turning in this
way or in that. The child's mind is the same. It is only
as objects become permanent and their relations fixed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
discrepancies and contradictions are felt and must be settled
in some stable way. As a rule, the success with which
a contradicted object maintains itself in our belief is proportional
to several qualities which it must possess. Of
these the one which would be put first by most people,
because it characterizes objects of sensation, is its&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Coerciveness over attention, or the mere power to
possess consciousness: then follow&mdash;</p>

<p>(2) Liveliness, or sensible pungency, especially in the
way of exciting pleasure or pain;</p>

<p>(3) Stimulating effect upon the will, i.e., capacity to
arouse active impulses, the more instinctive the better;</p>

<p>(4) Emotional interest, as object of love, dread, admiration,
desire, etc.;</p>

<p>(5) Congruity with certain favorite forms of contemplation&mdash;unity,
simplicity, permanence, and the like;</p>

<p>(6) Independence of other causes, and its own causal
importance.</p>

<p>These characters run into each other. Coerciveness is
the result of liveliness or emotional interest. What is lively
and interesting stimulates <i>eo ipso</i> the will; congruity holds
of active impulses as well as of contemplative forms; causal
independence and importance suit a certain contemplative
demand, etc. I will therefore abandon all attempt at a
formal treatment, and simply proceed to make remarks in
the most convenient order of exposition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As a whole, sensations are more lively and are judged
more real than conceptions; things met with every hour
more real than things seen once; attributes perceived when
awake, more real than attributes perceived in a dream.
But, owing to the <i>diverse relations contracted by the various
objects with each other,</i> the simple rule that the lively and
permanent is the real is often enough disguised. A conceived
thing may be deemed more real than a certain sensible
thing, if it only be intimately related to other sensible
things more vivid, permanent, or interesting than the first
one. Conceived molecular vibrations, e.g., are by the
physicist judged more real than felt warmth, because so
intimately related to all those other facts of motion in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
world which he has made his special study. Similarly, a
rare thing may be deemed more real than a permanent
thing if it be more widely related to other permanent
things. All the occasional crucial observations of science
are examples of this. A rare experience, too, is likely to
be judged more real than a permanent one, if it be more interesting
and exciting. Such is the sight of Saturn through
a telescope; such are the occasional insights and illuminations
which upset our habitual ways of thought.</p>

<p>But no mere floating conception, no mere disconnected
rarity, ever displaces vivid things or permanent things from
our belief. A conception, to prevail, must <i>terminate</i> in the
world of orderly sensible experience. A rare phenomenon,
to displace frequent ones, must belong with others more
frequent still. The history of science is strewn with wrecks
and ruins of theory&mdash;essences and principles, fluids and
forces&mdash;once fondly clung to, but found to hang together
with no facts of sense. And exceptional phenomena solicit
our belief in vain until such time as we chance to conceive
them as of kinds already admitted to exist. What science
means by 'verification' is no more than this, that no object
of conception shall be believed which sooner or later has
not some permanent and vivid object of sensation for its
<i>term</i>. Compare what was said on <a href="#Page_3">pages 3-7</a>, above.</p>

<p><i>Sensible objects are thus either our realities or the tests of our
realities. Conceived objects must show sensible effects or else be
disbelieved.</i> And the effects, even though reduced to relative
unreality when their causes come to view (as heat, which
molecular vibrations make unreal), are yet the things on
which our knowledge of the causes rests. Strange mutual
dependence this, in which the appearance needs the reality
in order to exist, but the reality needs the appearance in
order to be known!</p>

<p><i>Sensible vividness or pungency is then the vital factor in
reality when once the conflict between objects, and the connecting
of them together in the mind, has begun.</i> No object which
neither possesses this vividness in its own right nor is able
to borrow it from anything else has a chance of making
headway against vivid rivals, or of rousing in us that reaction
in which belief consists. On the vivid objects we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
<i>pin</i>, as the saying is, our faith in all the rest; and out
belief returns instinctively even to those of them from
which reflection has led it away. Witness the obduracy
with which the popular world of colors, sounds, and smells
holds its own against that of molecules and vibrations.
Let the physicist himself but nod, like Homer, and the
world of sense becomes his absolute reality again.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>That things originally devoid of this stimulating power
should be enabled, by association with other things which
have it, to compel our belief as if they had it themselves, is a
remarkable psychological fact, which since Hume's time it
has been impossible to overlook.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The vividness of the first conception," he writes, "diffuses itself
along the relations and is conveyed, as by so many pipes or channels, to
every idea that has any communication with the primary one....
Superstitious people are fond of the relics of saints and holy men, for the
same reason that they seek after types and images, in order to enliven
their devotion and give them a more intimate and strong conception of
those exemplary lives.... Now, 'tis evident one of the best relics a
devotee could procure would be the handiwork of a saint, and if his
clothes and furniture are ever to be considered in this light, 'tis because
they were once at his disposal, and were moved and affected by him; in
which respect they are... connected with him by a shorter train of
consequences than any of those from which we learn the reality of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
existence. This phenomenon clearly proves that a present impression,
with a relation of causation, may enliven any idea, and consequently
produce belief or assent, according to the precedent definition of it....
It has been remarked among the Mahometans as well as Christians
that those pilgrims who have seen Mecca or the Holy Land are ever
after more faithful and zealous believers than those who have not had
that advantage. A man whose memory presents him with a lively
image of the Red Sea and the Desert and Jerusalem and Galilee can
never doubt of any miraculous events which are related either by Moses
or the Evangelists. The lively idea of the places passes by an easy
transition to the facts which are supposed to have been related to them
by contiguity, and increases the belief by increasing the vivacity of the
conception. The remembrance of those fields and rivers has the same
influence as a new argument.... The ceremonies of the Catholic
religion may be considered as instances of the same nature. The
devotees of that strange superstition usually plead in excuse for the
mummeries with which they are upbraided that they feel the good effect
of external motions and postures and actions in enlivening their
devotion and quickening their fervor, which otherwise would decay,
if directed entirely to distant and immaterial objects. We shadow out
the objects of our faith, say they, in sensible types and images, and
render them more present to us by the immediate presence of these
types than it is possible for us to do merely by an intellectual view and
contemplation."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Hume's cases are rather trivial; and the things which
associated sensible objects make us believe in are supposed
by him to be unreal. But all the more manifest for that is
the fact of their psychological influence. Who does not
'realize' more the fact of a dead or distant friend's
existence, at the moment when a portrait, letter, garment
or other material reminder of him is found? The whole
notion of him then grows pungent and speaks to us and
shakes us, in a manner unknown at other times. In children's
minds, fancies and realities live side by side. But
however lively their fancies may be, they still gain help
from association with reality. The imaginative child
identifies its <i>dramatis personæ</i> with some doll or other
material object, and this evidently solidifies belief, little as
it may resemble what it is held to stand for. A thing not
too interesting by its own real qualities generally does the
best service here. The most useful doll I ever saw was a
large cucumber in the hands of a little Amazonian-Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
girl; she nursed it and washed it and rocked it to sleep in
a hammock, and talked to it all day long&mdash;there was no
part in life which the cucumber did not play. Says Mr.
Tylor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An imaginative child will make a dog do duty for a horse, or a soldier
for a shepherd, till at last the objective resemblance almost disappears,
and a bit of wood may be dragged about, resembling a ship on the
sea or a coach on the road. Here the likeness of the bit of wood to a
ship or coach is very slight indeed; but it is a thing, and can be moved
about,... and is an evident assistance to the child in enabling it to
arrange and develop its ideas.... Of how much use... may be
seen by taking it away, and leaving the child nothing to play with....
In later years and among highly educated people the mental process
which goes on in a child's playing with wooden soldiers and horses,
though it never disappears, must be sought for in more complex phenomena.
Perhaps nothing in after-life more closely resembles the effect
of a doll upon a child than the effect of the illustrations of a tale upon
a grown reader. Here the objective resemblance is very indefinite... yet
what reality is given to the scene by a good picture.... Mr. Backhouse
one day noticed in Van Diemen's Land a woman arranging
several stones that were flat, oval, and about two inches wide, and
marked in various directions with black and red lines. These, he
learned, represented absent friends, and one larger than the rest stood
for a fat native woman on Flinder's Island, known by the name of
Mother Brown. Similar practices are found among far higher races
than the ill-fated Tasmanians. Among some North American tribes a
mother who has lost a child keeps its memory ever present to her by
filling its cradle with black feathers and quills, and carrying it about
with her for a year or more. When she stops anywhere, she sets up the
cradle and talks to it as she goes about her work, just as she would
have done if the dead body had been still alive within it. Here we have
an image; but in Africa we find a rude doll representing the child, kept
as a memorial.... Bastian saw Indian women in Peru who had lost
an infant carrying about on their backs a wooden doll to represent it."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To many persons among us, photographs of lost ones
seem to be fetishes. They, it is true, resemble; but the
fact that the mere materiality of the reminder is almost as
important as its resemblance is shown by the popularity a
hundred years ago of the black taffeta 'silhouettes' which
are still found among family relics, and of one of which
Fichte could write to his affianced: '<i>Die Farbe fehlt, das
Auge fehlt, es fehlt der himmlische Ausdruck deiner lieblichen Züge</i>'&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
yet go on worshipping it all the same. The
opinion so stoutly professed by many, that language is essential
to thought, seems to have this much of truth in it,
that all our inward images tend invincibly to attach themselves
to something sensible, so as to gain in corporeity and
life. Words serve this purpose, gestures serve it, stones,
straws, chalk-marks, anything will do. As soon as anyone
of these things stands for the idea, the latter seems to be
more real. Some persons, the present writer among the
number, can hardly lecture without a blackboard: the abstract
conceptions must be symbolized by letters, squares
or circles, and the relations between them by lines. All
this symbolism, linguistic, graphic, and dramatic, has other
uses too, for it abridges thought and fixes terms. But one
of its uses is surely to rouse the believing reaction and give
to the ideas a more living reality. As, when we are told a
story, and shown the very knife that did the murder, the
very ring whose hiding-place the clairvoyant revealed, the
whole thing passes from fairy-land to mother-earth, so here
we believe all the more, if only we see that 'the bricks are
alive to tell the tale.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So much for the prerogative position of sensations in
regard to our belief. But among the sensations themselves
all are not deemed equally real. The more practically
important ones, the more permanent ones, and the more
æsthetically apprehensible ones are selected from the mass,
to be believed in most of all; the others are degraded to
the position of mere signs and suggestions of these. This
fact has already been adverted to in former chapters.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
The real color of a thing is that one color-sensation which
it gives us when most favorably lighted for vision. So
of its real size, its real shape, etc.&mdash;these are but optical
sensations selected out of thousands of others, because
they have æsthetic characteristics which appeal to our
convenience or delight. But I will not repeat what I have
already written about this matter, but pass on to our
treatment of tactile and muscular sensations, as 'primary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
qualities,' more real than those 'secondary' qualities which
eye and ear and nose reveal. Why do we thus so markedly
select the <i>tangible</i> to be the real? Our motives are not far
to seek. The tangible qualities are the least fluctuating.
When we get them at all we get them the same. The other
qualities fluctuate enormously as our relative position to
the object changes. Then, more decisive still, the tactile
properties are those most intimately connected with our
weal or woe. A dagger hurts us only when in contact with
our skin, a poison only when we take it into our mouths,
and we can only use an object for our advantage when we
have it in our muscular control. It is as tangibles, then,
that things concern us most; and the other senses, so far
as their practical use goes, do but warn us of what tangible
things to expect. They are but organs of anticipatory
touch, as Berkeley has with perfect clearness explained.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Among all sensations, the <i>most</i> belief-compelling are
those productive of pleasure or of pain. Locke expressly
makes the <i>pleasure</i>- or <i>pain</i>-giving quality to be the ultimate
human criterion of anything's reality. Discussing (with a
supposed Berkeleyan before Berkeley) the notion that all
our perceptions may be but a dream, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He may please to dream that I make him this answer... that I
believe he will allow a very manifest difference between dreaming of
being in the fire and being actually in it. But yet if he be resolved to
appear so sceptical as to maintain that what I call being actually in the
fire is nothing but a dream, and that we cannot thereby certainly know
that any such thing as fire actually exists without us, I answer that we,
certainly finding that pleasure or pain [or emotion of any sort] follows
upon the application of certain objects to us, whose existence we perceive,
or dream that we perceive by our senses, <i>this certainly is as great
as our happiness or misery,</i> beyond which we have no concernment to
know or to be."<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE INFLUENCE OF EMOTION AND ACTIVE IMPULSE ON
BELIEF.</h4>


<p>The quality of arousing emotion, of shaking, moving us
or inciting us to action, has as much to do with our belief in
an object's reality as the quality of giving pleasure or pain.
In <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIV360">Chapter XXIV</a> I shall seek to show that our emotions
probably owe their pungent quality to the bodily sensations
which they involve. Our tendency to believe in emotionally
exciting objects (objects of fear, desire, etc.) is thus explained
without resorting to any fundamentally new principle
of choice. Speaking generally, the more a conceived
object <i>excites</i> us, the more reality it has. The same object
excites us differently at different times. Moral and religious
truths come 'home' to us far more on some occasions than
on others. As Emerson says, "There is a difference between
one and another hour of life in their authority and subsequent
effect. Our faith comes in moments,... yet there
is a depth in those brief moments which constrains us to
ascribe more reality to them than to all other experiences."
The 'depth' is partly, no doubt, the insight into wider systems
of unified relation, but far more often than that it is
the emotional thrill. Thus, to descend to more trivial examples,
a man who has no belief in ghosts by daylight will
temporarily believe in them when, alone at midnight, he
feels his blood curdle at a mysterious sound or vision, his
heart thumping, and his legs impelled to flee. The thought
of falling when we walk along a curbstone awakens no emotion
of dread; so no sense of reality attaches to it, and we
are sure we shall not fall. On a precipice's edge, however,
the sickening emotion which the notion of a possible fall
engenders makes us believe in the latter's imminent reality,
and quite unfits us to proceed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<p>The greatest proof that a man is <i>sui compos</i> is his ability
to suspend belief in presence of an emotionally exciting
idea. To give this power is the highest result of education.
In untutored minds the power does not exist. <i>Every exciting
thought in the natural man carries credence with it. To
conceive with passion is eo ipso to affirm.</i> As Bagehot says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Caliph Omar burnt the Alexandrian Library, saying: 'All
books which contain what is not in the Koran are dangerous. All which
contain what is in it are useless!' Probably no one ever had an intenser
belief in anything than Omar had in this. Yet it is impossible to
imagine it preceded by an argument. His belief in Mahomet, in the
Koran, and in the sufficiency of the Koran, probably came to him in
spontaneous rushes of emotion; there may have been little vestiges of
argument floating here and there, but they did not justify the strength
of the emotion, still less did they create it, and they hardly even excused
it.... Probably, when the subject is thoroughly examined, conviction
will be found to be one of the intensest of human emotions, and one
most closely connected with the bodily state,... accompanied or preceded
by the sensation that Scott makes his seer describe as the prelude
of a prophecy:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'At length the fatal answer came,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In characters of living flame&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not spoke in words, nor blazed in scroll,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But borne and branded on my soul.'</span><br />
</p>

<p>A hot flash seems to burn across the brain. Men in these intense states
of mind have altered all history, changed for better or worse the creed
of myriads, and desolated or redeemed provinces or ages. Nor is this
intensity a sign of truth, for it is precisely strongest in those points in
which men differ most from each other. John Knox felt it in his anti-Catholicism;
Ignatius Loyola in his anti-Protestantism; and both, I
suppose, felt it as much as it is possible to feel it."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The reason of the belief is undoubtedly the bodily commotion
which the exciting idea sets up. 'Nothing which
I can feel like <i>that</i> can be false.' All our religious and
supernatural beliefs are of this order. The surest warrant
for immortality is the yearning of our bowels for our dear
ones; for God, the sinking sense it gives us to imagine no
such Providence or help. So of our political or pecuniary
hopes and fears, and things and persons dreaded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
desired. "A grocer has a full creed as to foreign policy,
a young lady a complete theory of the sacraments, as to
which neither has any doubt.... A girl in a country parsonage
will be sure that Paris never can be taken, or that
Bismarck is a wretch"&mdash;all because they have either conceived
these things at some moment with passion, or associated
them with other things which they have conceived
with passion.</p>

<p>M. Renouvier calls this belief of a thing for no other
reason than that we conceive it with passion, by the name
of <i>mental vertigo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Other objects whisper doubt or disbelief;
but the object of passion makes us deaf to all but
itself, and we affirm it unhesitatingly. Such objects are the
delusions of insanity, which the insane person can at odd
moments steady himself against, but which again return to
sweep him off his feet. Such are the revelations of mysticism.
Such, particularly, are the sudden beliefs which animate
mobs of men when frenzied impulse to action is
involved. Whatever be the action in point&mdash;whether the
stoning of a prophet, the hailing of a conqueror, the burning
of a witch, the baiting of a heretic or Jew, the starting
of a forlorn hope, or the flying from a foe&mdash;the fact that to
believe a certain object will <i>cause that action to explode</i> is a
sufficient reason for that belief to come. The motor impulse
sweeps it unresisting in its train.</p>

<p>The whole history of witchcraft and early medicine is
a commentary on the facility with which anything which
chances to be conceived is believed the moment the belief
chimes in with an emotional mood. 'The cause of sickness?'
When a savage asks the cause of anything he means to ask
exclusively 'What is to blame?' The theoretic curiosity
starts from the practical life's demands. Let some one then
accuse a necromancer, suggest a charm or spell which has
been cast, and no more 'evidence' is asked for. What evidence
is required beyond this intimate sense of the culprit's
responsibility, to which our very viscera and limbs reply?<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>
<p>Human credulity in the way of therapeutics has similar
psychological roots. If there is anything intolerable (especially
to the heart of a woman), it is to do nothing when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
loved one is sick or in pain. To do anything is a relief.
Accordingly, whatever remedy may be suggested is a spark
on inflammable soil. The mind makes its spring towards
action on that cue, sends for that remedy, and for a day at
least believes the danger past. Blame, dread, and hope are
thus the great belief-inspiring passions, and cover among
them the future, the present, and the past.</p>

<p>These remarks illustrate the earlier heads of the list on
<a href="#Page_292">page 292</a>. Whichever represented objects give us sensations,
especially interesting ones, or incite our motor impulses,
or arouse our hate, desire, or fear, are real enough
for us. Our requirements in the way of reality terminate in
our own acts and emotions, our own pleasures and pains.
These are the ultimate fixities from which, as we formerly
observed, the whole chain of our beliefs depends, object
hanging to object, as the bees, in swarming, hang to each
other until, <i>de proche en proche,</i> the supporting branch, the
Self, is reached and held.</p>


<h4>BELIEF IN OBJECTS OF THEORY.</h4>


<p>Now the merely conceived or imagined objects which
our mind represents as hanging to the sensations (causing
them, etc.), filling the gaps between them, and weaving their
interrupted chaos into order are innumerable. Whole systems
of them conflict with other systems, and our choice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
which system shall carry our belief is governed by principles
which are simple enough, however subtle and difficult
may be their application to details. <i>The conceived system, to
pass for true, must at least include the reality of the sensible
objects in it, by explaining them as effects on us, if nothing more.
The system which includes the most of them, and definitely explains
or pretends to explain the most of them, will, ceteris
paribus, prevail.</i> It is needless to say how far mankind still
is from having excogitated such a system. But the various
materialisms, idealisms, and hylozoisms show with what industry
the attempt is forever made. It is conceivable that
several rival theories should equally well include the actual
order of our sensations in their scheme, much as the one-fluid
and two-fluid theories of electricity formulated all the
common electrical phenomena equally well. The sciences
are full of these alternatives. Which theory is then to be
believed? <i>That theory will be most generally believed which,
besides offering us objects able to account satisfactorily for our
sensible experience</i>, <i>also offers those which are most interesting,
those which appeal most urgently to our æsthetic, emotional, and
active needs.</i> So here, in the higher intellectual life, the
same selection among general conceptions goes on which
went on among the sensations themselves. First, a word
of their relation to our emotional and active needs&mdash;and
here I can do no better than quote from an article published
some years ago:<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A philosophy may be unimpeachable in other respects, but either
of two defects will be fatal to its universal acceptance. First, its ultimate
principle must not be one that essentially baffles and disappoints
our dearest desires and most cherished powers. A pessimistic principle
like Schopenhauer's incurably vicious Will-substance, or Hartmann's
wicked jack-at-all-trades, the Unconscious, will perpetually call forth
essays at other philosophies. Incompatibility of the future with their
desires and active tendencies is, in fact, to most men a source of more
fixed disquietude than uncertainty itself. Witness the attempts to
overcome the 'problem of evil,' the 'mystery of pain.' There is no
problem of 'good.'</p>

<p>"But a second and worse defect in a philosophy than that of contradicting
our active propensities is to give them no Object whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
to press against. A philosophy whose principle is so incommensurate
with our most intimate powers as to deny them all relevancy in universal
affairs, as to annihilate their motives at one blow, will be even more
unpopular than pessimism. Better face the enemy than the eternal
Void! This is why materialism will always fail of universal adoption,
however well it may fuse things into an atomistic unity, however
clearly it may prophesy the future eternity. For materialism denies
reality to the objects of almost all the impulses which we most cherish.
The real <i>meaning</i> of the impulses, it says, is something which has no
emotional interest for us whatever. But what is called extradition is
quite as characteristic of our emotions as of our sense. Both point to an
Object as the cause of the present feeling. What an intensely objective
reference lies in fear! In like manner an enraptured man, a dreary-feeling
man, are not simply aware of their subjective states; if they
were, the force of their feelings would evaporate. Both believe there
is outward cause <i>why</i> they should feel as they do: either 'It is a glad
world! how good is life!' or 'What a loathsome tedium is existence!'
Any philosophy which annihilates the validity of the reference by explaining
away its objects or translating them into terms of no emotional
pertinency leaves the mind with little to care or act for. This
is the opposite condition from that of nightmare, but when acutely
brought home to consciousness it produces a kindred horror. In nightmare
we have motives to act, but no power; here we have powers, but
no motives. A nameless <i>Unheimlichkeit</i> comes over us at the thought
of there being nothing eternal in our final purposes, in the objects of
those loves and aspirations which are our deepest energies. The monstrously
lopsided equation of the universe and its knower, which we
postulate as the ideal of cognition, is perfectly paralleled by the no less
lopsided equation of the universe and the <i>doer</i>. We demand in it a
<i>character</i> for which our emotions and active propensities shall be a
match. Small as we are, minute as is the point by which the Cosmos
impinges upon each one of us, each one desires to feel that his reaction
at that point is congruous with the demands of the vast whole, that he
balances the latter, so to speak, and is able to do what it expects of
him. But as his abilities to 'do' lie wholly in the line of his natural
propensities; as he enjoys reaction with such emotions as fortitude,
hope, rapture, admiration, earnestness, and the like; and as he very
unwillingly reacts with fear, disgust, despair, or doubt,&mdash;a philosophy
which should legitimate only emotions of the latter sort would be sure
to leave the mind a prey to discontent and craving.</p>

<p>"It is far too little recognized how entirely the intellect is built up
of practical interests. The theory of Evolution is beginning to do very
good service by its reduction of all mentality to the type of reflex action.
Cognition, in this view, is but a fleeting moment, a cross-section at a
certain point of what in its totality is a motor phenomenon. In the
lower forms of life no one will pretend that cognition is anything more
than a guide to appropriate action. The germinal question concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
things brought for the first time before consciousness is not the theoretic
'What is that?' but the practical 'Who goes there?' or rather, as
Horwicz has admirably put it, 'What is to be done?'&mdash;'<i>Was fang' ich
an</i>?' In all our discussions about the intelligence of lower animals the
only test we use is that of their <i>acting</i> as if for a purpose. Cognition,
in short, is incomplete until discharged in act. And although it is true
that the later mental development, which attains its maximum through
the hypertrophied cerebrum of man, gives birth to a vast amount of
theoretic activity over and above that which is immediately ministerial
to practice, yet the earlier claim is only postponed, not effaced, and the
active nature asserts its rights to the end.</p>

<p>"If there be any truth at all in this view, it follows that however
vaguely a philosopher may define the ultimate universal datum, he cannot
be said to leave it unknown to us so long as he in the slightest
degree pretends that our emotional or active attitude towards it should
be of one sort rather than another. He who says, 'Life is real, life is
earnest,' however much he may speak of the fundamental mysteriousness
of things, gives a distinct definition to that mysteriousness by
ascribing to it the right to claim from us the particular mood called
seriousness, which means the willingness to live with energy, though
energy bring pain. The same is true of him who says that all is vanity.
Indefinable as the predicate vanity may be <i>in se</i>, it is clearly enough
something which permits anæsthesia, mere escape from suffering, to be
our rule of life. There is no more ludicrous incongruity than for
agnostics to proclaim with one breath that the substance of things is
unknowable, and with the next that the thought of it should inspire us
with admiration of its glory, reverence, and a willingness to add our co-operative
push in the direction towards which its manifestations seem
to be drifting. The unknowable may be unfathomed, but if it make
such distinct demands upon our activity, we surely are not ignorant of
its essential quality.</p>

<p>"If we survey the field of history and ask what feature all great
periods of revival, of expansion of the human mind, display in common,
we shall find, I think, simply this: that each and all of them have said
to the human being, 'The inmost nature of the reality is congenial to
<i>powers</i> which you possess.' In what did the emancipating message of
primitive Christianity consist, but in the announcement that God recognizes
those weak and tender impulses which paganism had so rudely
overlooked? Take repentance: the man who can do nothing rightly can
at least repent of his failures. But for paganism this faculty of repentance
was a pure supernumerary, a straggler too late for the fair.
Christianity took it and made it the one power within us which appealed
straight to the heart of God. And after the night of the Middle Ages
had so long branded with obloquy even the generous impulses of the flesh,
and defined the Reality to be such that only slavish natures could commune
with it, in what did the <i>Sursum corda!</i> of the Renaissance lie
but in the proclamation that the archetype of verity in things laid claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
on the widest activity of our whole æsthetic being? What were
Luther's mission and Wesley's but appeals to powers which even the
meanest of men might carry with them, faith and self-despair, but
which were personal, requiring no priestly intermediation, and which
brought their owner face to face with God? What caused the wild-fire
influence of Rousseau but the assurance he gave that man's nature
was in harmony with the nature of things, if only the paralyzing corruptions
of custom would stand from between? How did Kant and
Fichte, Goethe and Schiller, inspire their time with cheer, except by
saying, 'Use all your powers; that is the only obedience which the universe
exacts'? And Carlyle with his gospel of Work, of Fact, of Veracity,
how does he move us except by saying that the universe imposes
no tasks upon us but such as the most humble can perform? Emerson's
creed that everything that ever was or will be is here in the enveloping
Now; that man has but to obey himself&mdash;'He who will rest in what he
<i>is</i>, is a part of Destiny'&mdash;is in like manner nothing but an exorcism of
all scepticism as to the pertinency of one's natural faculties.</p>

<p>"In a word, 'Son of Man, <i>stand upon thy feet</i> and I will speak
unto thee!' is the only revelation of truth to which the solving epochs
have helped the disciple. But that has been enough to satisfy the
greater part of his rational need. <i>In se</i> and <i>per se</i> the universal essence
has hardly been more defined by any of these formulæ than by the
agnostic <i>x</i>; but the mere assurance that my powers, such as they are,
are not irrelevant to it, but pertinent, that it speaks to them and will
in some way recognize their reply, that I can be a match for it if I will,
and not a footless waif, suffices to make it rational to my feeling in the
sense given above. Nothing could be more absurd than to hope for the
definitive triumph of any philosophy which should refuse to legitimate,
and to legitimate in an emphatic manner, the more powerful of our
emotional and practical tendencies. Fatalism, whose solving word in
all crises of behavior is 'All striving is vain,' will never reign supreme,
for the impulse to take life strivingly is indestructible in the race.
Moral creeds which speak to that impulse will be widely successful in
spite of inconsistency, vagueness, and shadowy determination of expectancy.
Man needs a rule for his will, and will invent one if one be not
given him."</p></blockquote>

<p>After the emotional and active needs come the intellectual
and æsthetic ones. The two great æsthetic principles,
of richness and of ease, dominate our intellectual as well
as our sensuous life. And, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, no system which
should not be rich, simple, and harmonious would have a
chance of being chosen for belief, if rich, simple, and harmonious
systems were also there. Into the latter we should
unhesitatingly settle, with that welcoming attitude of the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
in which belief consists. To quote from a remarkable
book:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This law that our consciousness constantly tends to the minimum
of complexity and to the maximum of definiteness, is of great importance
for all our knowledge.... Our own activity of attention will thus
determine what we are to know and what we are to believe. If things
have more than a certain complexity, not only will our limited powers
of attention forbid us to unravel this complexity, but we shall strongly
desire to believe the things much simpler than they are. For our
thoughts about them will have a constant tendency to become as simple
and definite as possible. Put a man into a perfect chaos of phenomena&mdash;sounds,
sights, feelings&mdash;and if the man continued to exist, and to
be rational at all, his attention would doubtless soon find for him away
to make up some kind of rhythmic regularity, which he would impute
to the things about him, so as to imagine that he had discovered some
laws of sequence in this mad new world. And thus, in every case
where we fancy ourselves sure of a simple law of Nature, we must remember
that a great deal of the fancied simplicity may be due, in the
given case, not to Nature, but to the ineradicable prejudice of our own
minds in favor of regularity and simplicity. All our thoughts are determined,
in great measure, by this law of least effort, as it is found
exemplified in our activity of attention.... The aim of the whole
process seems to be to reach as complete and united a conception of
reality as possible, a conception wherein the greatest fulness of data
shall be combined with the greatest simplicity of conception. The effort
of consciousness seems to be to combine the greatest richness of content
with the greatest definiteness of organization."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The richness is got by including all the facts of sense
in the scheme; the simplicity, by deducing them out of the
smallest possible number of permanent and independent
primordial entities: the definite organization, by assimilating
these latter to ideal objects between which relations
of an inwardly rational sort obtain. What these ideal objects
and rational relations are will require a separate
chapter to show.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Meanwhile, enough has surely been said
to justify the assertion made above that no general off-hand
answer can be given as to which objects mankind shall
choose as its realities. The fight is still under way. Our
minds are yet chaotic; and at best we make a mixture and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
a compromise, as we yield to the claim of this interest or
that, and follow first one and then another principle in
turn. It is undeniably true that materialistic, or so-called
'scientific,' conceptions of the universe have so far gratified
the purely intellectual interests more than the mere sentimental
conceptions have. But, on the other hand, as
already remarked, they leave the emotional and active
interests cold. <i>The perfect object of belief would be a God or
'Soul of the World,' represented both optimistically and moralistically
(if such a combination could be), and withal so definitely
conceived as to show us why our phenomenal experiences
should be sent to us by Him in just the very way in which they
come.</i> All Science and all History would thus be accounted
for in the deepest and simplest fashion. The very room in
which I sit, its sensible walls and floor, and the feeling the
air and fire within it give me, no less than the 'scientific'
conceptions which I am urged to frame concerning the
mode of existence of all these phenomena when my back is
turned, would then all be corroborated, not de-realized, by
the ultimate principle of my belief. The World-soul sends
me just those phenomena in order that I may react upon
them; and among the reactions is the intellectual one of
spinning these conceptions. What is beyond the crude
experiences is not an <i>alternative</i> to them, but something
that <i>means</i> them for me here and now. It is safe to say
that, if ever such a system is satisfactorily excogitated,
mankind will drop all other systems and cling to that one
alone as real. Meanwhile the other systems coexist with
the attempts at that one, and, all being alike fragmentary,
each has its little audience and day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have now, I trust, shown sufficiently what the psychologic
sources of the sense of reality are. Certain postulates
are given in our nature; and whatever satisfies those postulates
is treated as if real.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> I might therefore finish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
chapter here, were it not that a few additional words will
set the truth in a still clearer light.</p>


<h4>DOUBT.</h4>


<p>There is hardly a common man who (if consulted)
would not say that things come to us in the first instance
<i>as ideas</i>; and that if we take them for realities, it is because
we <i>add something to them</i>, namely, the predicate of having
also '<i>real existence outside of our thought</i>.' This notion that
a higher faculty than the mere <i>having</i> of a conscious content
is needed to make us know anything real by its means
has pervaded psychology from the earliest times, and is the
tradition of Scholasticism, Kantism, and Common-sense.
Just as sensations must come as inward affections and then
be 'extradited;' as objects of memory must appear at first
as presently unrealities, and subsequently be 'projected'
backwards as past realities; so conceptions must be <i>entia
rationis</i> till a higher faculty uses them as windows to look
beyond the ego, into the real <i>extra</i>-mental world;&mdash;so runs
the orthodox and popular account.</p>

<p>And there is no question that this is a true account of
the way in which many of our later beliefs come to pass.
The logical distinction between the bare thought of an object
and belief in the object's reality is often a chronological
distinction as well. The having and the crediting of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
idea do not always coalesce; for often we first suppose and
then believe; first play with the notion, frame the hypothesis,
and then affirm the existence, of an object of thought.
And we are quite conscious of the succession of the two
mental acts. But these cases are none of them <i>primitive</i>
cases. They only occur in minds long schooled to doubt
by the contradictions of experience. <i>The primitive impulse
is to affirm immediately the reality of all that is conceived.</i><a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
When we do doubt, however, in what does the subsequent
resolution of the doubt consist? It either consists in a
purely verbal performance, the coupling of the adjectives
'real' or 'outwardly existing' (as predicates) to the thing
originally conceived (as subject); or it consists in the perception
in the given case of <i>that for which these adjectives</i>, abstracted
from other similar concrete cases, <i>stand</i>. But what
these adjectives stand for, we now know well. They stand
for certain relations (immediate, or through intermediaries)
to ourselves. Whatever concrete objects have hitherto stood
in those relations have been for us 'real,' 'outwardly existing.'
So that when we now abstractly admit a thing to be
'real' (without perhaps going through any definite perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
of its relations), it is as if we said "it belongs in the
same world with those other objects." Naturally enough,
we have hourly opportunities for this summary process of
belief. All remote objects in space or time are believed in
this way. When I believe that some prehistoric savage
chipped this flint, for example, the reality of the savage and
of his act makes no direct appeal either to my sensation,
emotion, or volition. What I mean by my belief in it is
simply my dim sense of a <i>continuity</i> between the long dead
savage and his doings and the present world of which the
flint forms part. It is pre-eminently a case for applying
our doctrine of the 'fringe' (see Vol I. p. 258). When I think
the savage with one fringe of relationship, I believe in him;
when I think him without that fringe, or with another one
(as, e.g., if I should class him with 'scientific vagaries' in
general), I disbelieve him. The word 'real' itself is, in
short, a fringe.</p>


<h4>RELATIONS OF BELIEF AND WILL.</h4>


<p>We shall see in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXV395">Chapter XXV</a> that will consists in
nothing but a manner of attending to certain objects, or
consenting to their stable presence before the mind. The
objects, in the case of will, are those whose existence
depends on our thought, movements of our own body for
example, or facts which such movements executed in future
may make real. Objects of belief, on the contrary, are those
which do not change according as we think regarding them.
I <i>will</i> to get up early to-morrow morning; I <i>believe</i> that I
got up late yesterday morning; I <i>will</i> that my foreign
bookseller in Boston shall procure me a German book and
write to him to that effect. I <i>believe</i> that he will make me
pay three dollars for it when it comes, etc. Now the important
thing to notice is that this difference between the
objects of will and belief is entirely immaterial, as far as
the relation of the mind to them goes. All that the mind
does is in both cases the same; it looks at the object and
consents to its existence, espouses it, says 'it shall be my
reality.' It turns to it, in short, in the interested active
emotional way. The rest is done by nature, which in some
cases <i>makes</i> the objects real which we think of in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
manner, and in other cases does not. Nature cannot change
the past to suit our thinking. She cannot change the stars
or the winds; but she <i>does</i> change our bodies to suit our
thinking, and through their instrumentality changes much
besides; so the great practical distinction between objects
which we may will or unwill, and objects which we can merely
believe or disbelieve, grows up, and is of course one of the
most important distinctions in the world. Its roots, however,
do not lie in psychology, but in physiology; as the
chapter on Volition will abundantly make plain. <i>Will and
Belief, in short, meaning a certain relation between objects and
the Self, are two names for one and the same</i> <span class="smcap">psychological</span>
<i>phenomenon</i>. All the questions which arise concerning one
are questions which arise concerning the other. The causes
and conditions of the peculiar relation must be the same
in both. The free-will question arises as regards belief.
If our wills are indeterminate, so must our beliefs be, etc.
The first act of free-will, in short, would naturally be to
believe in free-will, etc. In <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVI430">Chapter XXVI</a>, I shall mention
this again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A practical observation may end this chapter. If belief
consists in an emotional reaction of the entire man on an
object, how <i>can</i> we believe at will? We cannot control our
emotions. Truly enough, a man cannot believe at will
abruptly. Nature sometimes, and indeed not very infrequently,
produces instantaneous conversions for us. She
suddenly puts us in an active connection with objects of
which she had till then left us cold. "I realize for the first
time," we then say, "what that means!" This happens often
with moral propositions. We have often heard them; but
now they shoot into our lives; they move us; we feel their
living force. Such instantaneous beliefs are truly enough not
to be achieved by will. But <i>gradually</i> our will can lead us to
the same results by a very simple method: <i>we need only
in cold blood</i> <span class="smcap">act</span> <i>as if the thing in question were real, and keep
acting as if it were real, and it will infallibly end by growing
into such a connection with our life that it will become real.</i>
It will become so knit with habit and emotion that our
interests in it will be those which characterize belief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Those to whom 'God' and 'Duty' are now mere names
can make them much more than that, if they make a little
sacrifice to them every day. But all this is so well known
in moral and religious education that I need say no more.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

foot would be lifted to go down; I should be conscious to excitement
that I was losing my chance; but I should be unable to stir until all these
absurdities were entertained and disposed of. In the most critical moments
of my life, when I ought to have been so <i>engrossed as to leave no room for
any secondary thoughts</i>, I have been oppressed by the inability to be at
peace. And in the most ordinary circumstances it is all the same. Let me
instance the other morning I went to walk. The day was biting cold, but
I was unable to proceed except by jerks. Once I got arrested, my feet in
a muddy pool. One foot was lifted to go, knowing that it was not good to
be standing in water, but there I was fast, the cause of detention being the
discussing with myself the reasons why I should not stand in that pool."

The syllable <i>ex</i> in the word Existence, <i>da</i> in the word <i>Dasein</i>, express
it. 'The candle exists' is equivalent to 'The candle is <i>over there</i>.'
And the 'over there' means real space, space related to other reals. The
proposition amounts to saying: 'The candle is in the same space with
other reals.' It affirms of the candle a very concrete predicate&mdash;namely,
this relation to other particular concrete things. <i>Their</i> real existence, as
we shall later see, resolves itself into their peculiar relation to <i>ourselves</i>.
Existence is thus no substantive quality when we predicate it of any object;
it is a relation, ultimately terminating in ourselves, and at the moment
when it terminates, becoming a <i>practical</i> relation. But of this more
anon. I only wish now to indicate the superficial nature of the distinction
between the existential and the attributive proposition.</p></div>

did not <i>really</i> marry Rebecca, as Thackeray <i>falsely</i> makes him do. The
real Ivanhoe-world is the one which Scott wrote down for us. <i>In that
world</i> Ivanhoe does <i>not</i> marry Rebecca. The objects within that world
are knit together by perfectly definite relations, which can be affirmed
or denied. Whilst absorbed in the novel, we turn our backs on all other
worlds, and, for the time, the Ivanhoe-world remains our absolute reality.
When we wake from the spell, however, we find a still more real world,
which reduces Ivanhoe, and all things connected with him, to the Active
status, and relegates them to one of the sub-universes grouped under No. 5.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_297_297" id="Footnote_297_297"></a><a href="#FNanchor_297_297"><span class="label">[297]</span></a> The world of dreams is our real world whilst we are sleeping, because
our attention then lapses from the sensible world. Conversely, when we
wake the attention usually lapses from the dream-world and that becomes
unreal. But if a dream haunts us and compels our attention during the
day it is very apt to remain figuring in our consciousness as a sort of sub-universe
alongside of the waking world. Most people have probably had
dreams which it is hard to imagine not to have been glimpses into an
actually existing region of being, perhaps a corner of the 'spiritual world.'
And dreams have accordingly in all ages been regarded as revelations, and
have played a large part in furnishing forth mythologies and creating
themes for faith to lay hold upon. The 'larger universe,' here, which
helps us to believe both in the dream and in the waking reality which is
its immediate reductive, is the <i>total</i> universe, of Nature <i>plus</i> the Supernatural.
The dream holds true, namely, in one half of that universe; the
waking perceptions in the other half. Even to-day dream-objects figure
among the realities in which some 'psychic-researchers' are seeking to rouse
our belief. All our theories, not only those about the supernatural, but
our philosophic and scientific theories as well, are like our dreams in rousing
such different degrees of belief in different minds.</p></div>

"When, after the simple conception of anything, we would conceive it as
existent, we in reality make no addition to, or alteration of, our first idea.
Thus, when we affirm that God is existent, we simply form the idea of
such a being as He is represented to us; nor is the existence which we attribute
to Him conceived by a particular idea, which we join to His other
qualities, and can again separate and distinguish from them.... The belief
of the existence joins no new idea to those which compose the ideas of
the object. When I think of God, when I think of Him as existent, and
when I believe Him to be existent, my idea of Him neither increases nor
diminishes. But as 'tis certain there is a great difference betwixt the simple
conception of the existence of an object and the belief of it, and as this
difference lies not in the facts or compositions of the idea which we conceive,
it follows that it must lie in the manner in which we conceive it."

and in which the one or the other then prevails according as the
sensations are felt by ourselves or merely known by report, is interestingly
illustrated at the present day by the state of public belief about 'spiritualistic'
phenomena. There exist numerous narratives of movement without
contact on the part of articles of furniture and other material objects, in
the presence of certain privileged individuals called mediums. Such movement
violates our memories, and the whole system of accepted physical
'science.' Consequently those who have not seen it either brand the
narratives immediately as lies or call the phenomena 'illusions' of sense,
produced by fraud or due to hallucination. But one who has actually seen
such a phenomenon, under what seems to him sufficiently 'test-conditions,'
will hold to his sensible experience through thick and thin, even though
the whole fabric of 'science' should be rent in twain. That man would
be a weak-spirited creature indeed who should allow any fly-blown generalities
about 'the liability of the senses to be deceived' to bully him out of
his adhesion to what for him was an indubitable experience of sight. A
man may err in this obstinacy, sure enough, in any particular case. But
the spirit that animates him is that on which ultimately the very life and
health of Science rest.</p></div>

him, which does him harm and puts him to great pain.... And if our
dreamer pleases to try whether the glowing heat of a glass furnace be
barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy man's fancy by putting his

he could wish, that it is something more than bare imagination. So that
the evidence is as great as we can desire, being as certain to us as our pleasure

either of knowledge or being. Such an assurance of the existence
of things without us is sufficient to direct us in the attaining the good and

we have of being made acquainted with them," (<i>Ibid.</i> bk. iv.

miles to see him. There happened, some months after, an uncommon

H. M. Stanley, Through the Dark Continent, ii. 388: "On the third
day of our stay at Mowa, feeling quite comfortable amongst the people, on
account of their friendly bearing, I began to write in my note-book the
terms for articles, in order to improve my already copious vocabulary of
native words. I had proceeded only a few minutes when I observed a
strange commotion amongst the people who had been flocking about me,
and presently they ran away. In a short time we heard war-cries ringing
loudly and shrilly over the table-land. Two hours afterwards a long line
of warriors were seen descending the table-land and advancing towards
our camp. There may have been between five and six hundred of them.
We, on the other hand, had made but few preparations except such as
would justify us replying to them in the event of the actual commencement
of hostilities. But I had made many firm friends among them, and
I firmly believed that I should be able to avert an open rupture. When
they had assembled at about a hundred yards in front of our camp, Safeni
and I walked up towards them and sat down midway. Some half-dozen
of the Mowa people came near, and the shauri began.
</p>
<p>
"'What is the matter, my friends?' I asked. 'Why do you come
with guns in your hands, in such numbers, as though you were coming
to fight? Fight? fight us, your friends! Tut! this is some great mistake,
surely.'
</p>
<p>
"'Mundele,' replied one of them,... 'our people saw you yesterday
make marks on some tara-tara [paper]. This is very bad. Our country
will waste, our goats will die, our bananas will rot, and our women will
dry up. What have we done to you that you should wish to kill us?
We have sold you food and we have brought you wine each day. Your
people are allowed to wander where they please without trouble. Why is
the Mundele so wicked? We have gathered together to fight you if you
do not burn that tara-tara now before our eyes. If you burn it we go
away, and shall be your friends as heretofore.'
</p>
<p>
"'I told them to rest there, and left Safeni in their hands as a pledge
that I should return. My tent was not fifty yards from the spot, but
while going towards it my brain was busy in devising some plan to foil
this superstitious madness. My note-book contained a vast number of valuable
notes.... I could not sacrifice it to the childish caprice of savages.
As I was rummaging my book-box, I came across a volume of Shakespeare
[Chandos edition] much worn, and well thumbed, and which was of the
same size as my field-book; its cover was similar also, and it might be
passed for the field-book, provided that no one remembered its appearance
too well. I took it to them. 'Is this the tara-tara, friends, that you wish
burned?'
</p>
<p>
"'Yes, yes, that is it.'
</p>
<p>
"'Well, take it, and burn it, or keep it.'
</p>
<p>
"'M&mdash;m. No, no, no. We will not touch it. It is fetish. You must
burn it.'
</p>
<p>
"'I! Well, let it be so. I will do anything to please my good friends
of Mowa.'
</p>
<p>
"'We walked to the nearest fire. I breathed a regretful farewell to my
genial companion, which, during my many weary hours of night, had
assisted to relieve my mind when oppressed by almost intolerable woes,
and then gravely consigned the innocent Shakespeare to the flames, heaping
the brush fuel over it with ceremonious care.
</p>
<p>
"'A-h-h,' breathed the poor deluded natives sighing their relief....
'There is no trouble now.'... And something approaching to a cheer
was shouted among them, which terminated the episode of the burning of
Shakespeare."</p></div>

'external' world. "If the history of popular speculation on these topics
could be written, how much of cowardice and shuffling would be found in
the behavior of the natural mind before the question, 'How dost thou
know of an external reality?' Instead of simply and plainly answering:
'I mean by the external world in the first place something that I accept
or demand, that I posit, postulate, actively construct on the basis of sense-data,'
the natural man gives us all kinds of vague compromise answers....
Where shall these endless turnings and twistings have an end?... All
these lesser motives are appealed to, and the one ultimate motive is
neglected. The ultimate motive with the man of every-day life is the <i>will
to have an external world.</i> Whatever consciousness contains, reason will
persist in spontaneously adding the thought: 'But there <i>shall be</i> something
beyond this.'... The popular assurance of an external world is the <i>fixed
determination to make one,</i> now and henceforth." (Religious Aspect of
Philosophy, p. 304&mdash;the italics are my own.) This immixture of the will
appears most flagrantly in the fact that although external matter is
doubted commonly enough, minds external to our own are never doubted.
We need them too much, are too essentially social to dispense with them.
Semblances of matter may suffice to react upon, but not semblances of
communing souls. A psychic solipsism is too hideous a mockery of our
wants, and, so far as I know, has never been seriously entertained.&mdash;Chapters
ix and x of Prof. Royce's work are on the whole the clearest
account of the psychology of belief with which I am acquainted.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_317_317" id="Footnote_317_317"></a><a href="#FNanchor_317_317"><span class="label">[317]</span></a> "The leading fact in Belief, according to my view of it, is our Primitive
Credulity. We begin by believing everything; whatever is, is true....
The animal born in the morning of a summer day proceeds upon the
fact of daylight; assumes the perpetuity of that fact. Whatever it is
disposed to do, it does without misgivings. If in the morning it began a
round of operations continuing for hours, under the full benefit of daylight,
it would unhesitatingly begin the same round in the evening. Its
state of mind is practically one of unbounded confidence; but, as yet, it
does not understand what confidence means.
</p>
<p>
"The pristine assurance is soon met by checks; a disagreeable experience
leading to new insight. To be thwarted and opposed is one of our earliest
and most frequent pains. It develops the sense of a distinction between
free and obstructed impulses; the unconsciousness of an open way is exchanged
for consciousness; we are now said properly to believe in what
has never been contradicted, as we disbelieve in what has been contradicted.
We believe that, after the dawn of day, there is before us a continuance
of light; we do not believe that this light is to continue forever.
</p>
<p>
"Thus, the vital circumstance in belief is never to be contradicted&mdash;never
to lose <i>prestige</i>. The number of repetitions counts for little in the process:
we are as much convinced after ten as after fifty; we are more convinced
by ten unbroken than by fifty for and one against." (Bain: The Emotions

our belief in all other things a matter of <i>association</i> with these. So far so
good; but as he makes no mention of emotional or volitional reaction, Bain
rightly charges him with treating belief as a purely intellectual state. For
Bain belief is rather an incident of our active life. When a thing is such
as to make us <i>act</i> on it, then we believe it, according to Bain. "But how
about past things, or remote things, upon which no reaction of ours is possible?
And how about belief in things which <i>check</i> action?" says Sully;
who considers that we believe a thing only when "the idea of it has an inherent
tendency to approximate in character and intensity to a sensation."
It is obvious that each of these authors emphasizes a true aspect of the
question. My own account has sought to be more complete, sensation,
association, and active reaction all being acknowledged to be concerned.
The most compendious possible formula perhaps would be that <i>our belief
and attention</i> are the same fact. For the moment, what we attend to is
reality; Attention is a motor reaction; and we are so made that sensations
force attention from us. On Belief and Conduct see an article by Leslie
Stephen, Fortnightly Review, July 1888.
</p>
<p>
A set of facts have been recently brought to my attention which I
hardly know how to treat, so I say a word about them in this foot-note. I
refer to a type of experience which has frequently found a place amongst
the 'Yes' answers to the 'Census of Hallucinations,' and which is generally
described by those who report it as an 'impression of the presence' of
someone near them, although no sensation either of sight, hearing, or touch
is involved. From the way in which this experience is spoken of by those
who have had it, it would appear to be an extremely definite and positive
state of mind, coupled with a belief in the reality of its object quite as
strong as any direct sensation ever gives. And yet <i>no</i> sensation seems to
be connected with it at all. Sometimes the person whose nearness is thus
impressed is a known person, dead or living, sometimes an unknown one.
His attitude and situation are often very definitely impressed, and so, sometimes
(though not by way of hearing), are words which he wishes to say.
</p>
<p>
The phenomenon would seem to be due to a pure <i>conception</i> becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
saturated with the sort of stinging urgency which ordinarily only sensations
bring. But I cannot yet persuade myself that the urgency in question
consists in concomitant emotional and motor impulses. The 'impression'
may come quite suddenly and depart quickly; it may carry no
emotional suggestions, and wake no motor consequences beyond those
involved in attending to it. Altogether, the matter is somewhat paradoxical,
and no conclusion can be come to until more definite data are obtained.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most curious case of the sort which I have received is the
following. The subject of the observation, Mr. P., is an exceptionally
intelligent witness, though the words of the narrative are his wife's.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. P. has all his life been the occasional subject of rather singular
delusions or impressions of various kinds. If I had belief in the existence
of latent or embryo faculties, other than the five senses, I should explain
them on that ground. Being totally blind, his other perceptions are
abnormally keen and developed, and given the existence of a rudimentary
sixth sense, it would be only natural that this also should be more acute in
him than in others. One of the most interesting of his experiences in this
line was the frequent apparition of a corpse some years ago, which may be
worth the attention of your Committee on that subject. At the time Mr.
P. had a music-room in Boston on Beacon Street, where he used to do
severe and protracted practice with little interruption. Now, all one season
it was a very familiar occurrence with him while in the midst of work to
feel a cold draft of air suddenly upon his face, with a prickling sensation
at the roots of his hair, when he would turn from the piano, and a figure
which he knew to be dead would come sliding under the crack of the door
from without, flattening itself to squeeze through and rounding out again
to the human form. It was of a middle-aged man, and drew itself along
the carpet on hands and knees, but with head thrown back till it reached
the sofa, upon which it stretched itself. It remained some moments, but
vanished always if Mr. P. spoke or made a decided movement. The most
singular point in the occurrence was its frequent repetition. He might
expect it on any day between two and four o'clock, and it came always
heralded by the same sudden cold shiver, and was invariably the same figure
which went through the same movements. He afterwards traced the
whole experience to strong tea. He was in the habit of taking cold tea,
which always stimulates him, for lunch, and on giving up this practice he
never saw this or any other apparition again. However, even allowing, as
is doubtless true, that the event was a delusion of nerves first fatigued by
overwork and then excited by this stimulant, there is one point which is
still wholly inexplicable and highly interesting to me. Mr. P. has no
memory whatever of sight, nor conception of it. It is impossible for him
to form any idea of what we mean by light or color, consequently he has
no cognizance of any object which does not reach his sense of hearing or
of touch, though these are so acute as to give a contrary impression sometimes
to other people. When he becomes aware of the presence of a person
or an object, by means which seem mysterious to outsiders, he can always
trace it naturally and legitimately to slight echoes, perceptible only to his
keen ears, or to differences in atmospheric pressure, perceptible only to his
acute nerves of touch; but with the apparition described, for the only time
in his experience, he was aware of presence, size, and appearance, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the use of either of these mediums. The figure never produced the least
sound nor came within a number of feet of his person, yet he knew that it
was a man, that it moved, and in what direction, even that it wore a full
beard, which, like the thick curly hair, was partially gray; also that it
was dressed in the style of suit known as 'pepper and salt.' These points
were all perfectly distinct and invariable each time. If asked how he
perceived them, he will answer he cannot tell, he simply knew it, and so
strongly and so distinctly that it is impossible to shake his opinion as to
the exact details of the man's appearance. It would seem that in this delusion
of the senses he really <i>saw</i>, as he has never done in the actual experiences
of life, except in the first two years of childhood."
</p>
<p>
On cross-examining Mr. P., I could not make out that there was anything
like visual imagination involved, although he was quite unable to
describe in just what terms the false perception was carried on. It seemed
to be more like an intensely definite <i>conception</i> than anything else, a conception
to which the feeling of <i>present reality</i> was attached, but in no such
shape as easily to fall under the heads laid down in my text.</p></div>

<h4>REASONING.</h4>


<p>We talk of man being the rational animal; and the traditional
intellectualist philosophy has always made a great
point of treating the brutes as wholly irrational creatures.
Nevertheless, it is by no means easy to decide just what is
meant by reason, or how the peculiar thinking process
called reasoning differs from other thought-sequences which
may lead to similar results.</p>

<p>Much of our thinking consists of trains of images suggested
one by another, of a sort of spontaneous revery of
which it seems likely enough that the higher brutes should
be capable. This sort of thinking leads nevertheless to
rational conclusions, both practical and theoretical. The
links between the terms are either 'contiguity' or 'similarity,'
and with a mixture of both these things we can hardly
be very incoherent. As a rule, in this sort of irresponsible
thinking, the terms which fall to be coupled together
are empirical concretes, not abstractions. A sunset may
call up the vessel's deck from which I saw one last summer,
the companions of my voyage, my arrival into port, etc.; or
it may make me think of solar myths, of Hercules' and
Hector's funeral pyres, of Homer and whether he could
write, of the Greek alphabet, etc. If habitual contiguities
predominate, we have a prosaic mind; if rare contiguities,
or similarities, have free play, we call the person fanciful,
poetic, or witty. But the thought as a rule is of matters
taken in their entirety. Having been thinking of one, we
find later that we are thinking of another, to which we have
been lifted along, we hardly know how. If an abstract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
quality figures in the procession, it arrests our attention
but for a moment, and fades into something else; and is
never very abstract. Thus, in thinking of the sun-myths, we
may have a gleam of admiration at the gracefulness of the
primitive human mind, or a moment of disgust at the narrowness
of modern interpreters. But, in the main, we
think less of qualities than of whole things, real or possible,
just as we may experience them.</p>

<p>The upshot of it may be that we are reminded of some
practical duty: we write a letter to a friend abroad, or we
take down the lexicon and study our Greek lesson. Our
thought is rational, and leads to a rational act, but it can
hardly be called reasoning in a strict sense of the term.</p>

<p>There are other shorter flights of thought, single couplings
of terms which suggest one another by association,
which approach more to what would commonly be classed
as acts of reasoning proper. Those are where a present sign
suggests an unseen, distant, or future reality. Where the
sign and what it suggests are both concretes which have
been coupled together on previous occasions, the inference
is common to both brutes and men, being really nothing
more than association by contiguity. A and B, dinner-bell
and dinner, have been experienced in immediate succession.
Hence A no sooner falls upon the sense than B is
anticipated, and steps are taken to meet it. The whole
education of our domestic beasts, all the cunning added by
age and experience to wild ones, and the greater part of
our human knowingness consists in the ability to make a
mass of inferences of this simplest sort. Our 'perceptions,'
or recognitions of what objects are before us, are inferences
of this kind. We feel a patch of color, and we say 'a distant
house,' a whiff of odor crosses us, and we say 'a
skunk,' a faint sound is heard, and we call it 'a railroad
train.' Examples are needless; for such inferences of sensations
not presented form the staple and tissue of our
perceptive life, and our <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">Chapter XIX</a> was full of them,
illusory or veracious. They have been called <i>unconscious
inferences</i>. Certainly we are commonly unconscious that
we are inferring at all. The sign and the signified melt
into what seems to us the object of a single pulse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
thought. <i>Immediate inferences</i> would be a good name for
these simple acts of reasoning requiring but two terms,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
were it not that formal logic has already appropriated the
expression for a more technical use.</p>


<h4>'RECEPTS.'</h4>


<p>In these first and simplest inferences the conclusion
may follow so continuously upon the 'sign' that the latter
is not discriminated or attended to as a separate object by the
mind. Even now we can seldom define the optical signs
which lead us to infer the shapes and distances of the objects
which by their aid we so unhesitatingly perceive.
The objects, too, when thus inferred, are <i>general</i> objects.
The dog crossing a scent thinks of a deer in general, or of
another dog in general, not of a particular deer or dog. To
these most primitive abstract objects Dr. G. J. Romanes
gives the name of <i>recepts</i> or <i>generic</i> ideas, to distinguish
them from concepts and general ideas properly so called.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
They are not analyzed or defined, but only imagined.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It requires but a slight analysis of our ordinary mental processes
to prove that all our simpler ideas are group-arrangements which have
been formed spontaneously or without any of that intentionally comparing,
sifting, and combining process which is required in the higher
departments of ideational activity. The comparing, sifting, and combining
is here done, as it were, <i>for</i> the conscious agent, not <i>by</i> him.
Recepts are received; it is only concepts that require to be conceived....
If I am crossing a street and hear behind me a sudden shout, I
do not require to wait in order to predicate to myself that there is probably
a hansom-cab just about to run me down: a cry of this kind, and
in those circumstances, is so intimately associated in my mind with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
purpose, that the idea which it arouses need not rise above the level of
a recept; and the adaptive movements on my part which that idea immediately
prompts are performed without any intelligent reflection.
Yet, on the other hand, they are neither reflex actions nor instinctive
actions; they are what may be termed receptual actions, or actions depending
on recepts."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>"How far can this kind of unnamed or non-conceptional
ideation extend?" Dr. Romanes asks; and answers by a
variety of examples taken from the life of brutes, for which
I must refer to his book. One or two of them, however, I
will quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Houzeau writes that while crossing a wide and arid plain in Texas,
his two dogs suffered greatly from thirst, and that between thirty and
forty times they rushed down the hollows to search for water. The hollows
were not valleys, and there were no trees in them, or any other
difference in the vegetation; and as they were absolutely dry, there
could have been no smell of damp earth. The dogs behaved as if they
knew that a dip in the ground offered them the best chance of finding
water, and Houzeau has often witnessed the same behavior in other animals....</p>

<p>"Mr. Darwin writes: 'When I say to my terrier in an eager voice
(and I have made the trial many times), "Hi! hi! where is it?" she at
once takes it as a sign that something is to be hunted, and generally
first looks quickly all round, and then rushes into the nearest thicket,
to scout for any game, but finding nothing she looks up into any neighboring
tree for a squirrel. Now do not these actions clearly show that
she had in her mind a general idea, or concept, that some animal is to
be discovered and hunted?'"<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>They certainly show this. But the idea in question is
of an object <i>about</i> which nothing farther may be articulately
known. The thought of it prompts to activity, but to no
theoretic consequence. Similarly in the following example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Water-fowl adopt a somewhat different mode of alighting upon
land, or even upon ice, from that which they adopt when alighting
upon water; and those kinds which dive from a height (such as terns
and gannets) never do so upon land or upon ice. These facts prove
that the animals have one recept answering to a solid surface, and another
answering to a fluid. Similarly a man will not dive from a height
over hard ground or over ice, nor will he jump into water in the same
way as he jumps upon dry land. In other words, like the water-fowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
he has two distinct recepts, one of which answers to solid ground, and
the other to an unresisting fluid. But unlike the water-fowl he is able
to bestow upon each of these recepts a name, and thus to raise them
both to the level of concepts. So far as the practical purposes of locomotion
are concerned, it is of course immaterial whether or not he thus
raises his recepts into concepts; but ... for many other purposes it is
of the highest importance that he is able to do this."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p></blockquote>


<h4>IN REASONING, WE PICK OUT ESSENTIAL QUALITIES.</h4>


<p>The chief of these purposes is <i>predication</i>, a theoretic
function which, though it always leads eventually to some
kind of action, yet tends as often as not to inhibit the immediate
motor response to which the simple inferences of
which we have been speaking give rise. In reasoning, A
may suggest B; but B, instead of being an idea which is
simply <i>obeyed</i> by us, is an idea which suggests the distinct
additional idea C. And where the train of suggestion is one
of reasoning distinctively so called as contrasted with mere
revery or 'associative' sequence, the ideas bear certain
inward relations to each other which we must proceed to
examine with some care.</p>

<p>The result C yielded by a true act of reasoning is apt
to be a thing voluntarily <i>sought</i>, such as the means to a
proposed end, the ground for an observed effect, or the
effect of an assumed cause. All these results may be
thought of as concrete things, but they are <i>not suggested immediately
by other concrete things</i>, as in the trains of simply associative
thought. They are linked to the concretes which
precede them by intermediate steps, and these steps are
formed by <i>general characters</i> articulately denoted and expressly
analyzed out. A thing inferred by reasoning need
neither have been an habitual associate of the datum from
which we infer it, nor need it be similar to it. It may be
a thing entirely unknown to our previous experience, something
which no simple association of concretes could ever
have evoked. The great difference, in fact, between that
simpler kind of rational thinking which consists in the concrete
objects of past experience merely suggesting each
other, and reasoning distinctively so called, is this, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
whilst the empirical thinking is only reproductive, reasoning
is productive. An empirical, or 'rule-of-thumb,' thinker
can deduce nothing from data with whose behavior and
associates in the concrete he is unfamiliar. But put a
reasoner amongst a set of concrete objects which he has
neither seen nor heard of before, and with a little time, if
he is a good reasoner, he will make such inferences from
them as will quite atone for his ignorance. Reasoning
helps us out of unprecedented situations&mdash;situations for
which all our common associative wisdom, all the 'education'
which we share in common with the beasts, leaves us
without resource.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Let us make this ability to deal with</i> <span class="smcap">novel</span> <i>data the technical
differentia of reasoning.</i> This will sufficiently mark
it out from common associative thinking, and will immediately
enable us to say just what peculiarity it contains.</p>

<p><i>It contains analysis and abstraction.</i> Whereas the merely
empirical thinker stares at a fact in its entirety, and remains
helpless, or gets 'stuck,' if it suggests no concomitant or
similar, the reasoner breaks it up and notices some one of
its separate attributes. This attribute he takes to be the
essential part of the whole fact before him. This attribute
has properties or consequences which the fact until then
was not known to have, but which, now that it is noticed
to contain the attribute, it must have.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Call the fact or concrete datum S;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">the essential attribute M;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">the attribute's property P.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Then the reasoned inference of P from S cannot be
made without M's intermediation. The 'essence' M is
thus that third or middle term in the reasoning which a
moment ago was pronounced essential. <i>For his original
concrete S the reasoner substitutes its abstract property, M.</i>
What is true of M, what is coupled with M, then holds
true of S, is coupled with S. As M is properly one of the
<i>parts</i> of the entire S, <i>reasoning may then be very well defined
as the substitution of parts and their implications or consequences
for wholes</i>. And the art of the reasoner will consist of two
stages:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>
<p>First, <i>sagacity</i>,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> or the ability to discover what part, M,
lies embedded in the whole S which is before him;</p>

<p>Second, <i>learning</i>, or the ability to recall promptly M's
consequences, concomitants, or implications.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>If we glance at the ordinary syllogism&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">M is P;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">S is M;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Therefore S is P</span><br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>
<p>&mdash;we see that the second or minor premise, the 'subsumption'
as it is sometimes called, is the one requiring the sagacity;
the first or major the one requiring the fertility, or
fulness of learning. Usually the learning is more apt to be
ready than the sagacity, the ability to seize fresh aspects
in concrete things, being rarer than the ability to learn old
rules; so that, in most actual cases of reasoning, the minor
premise, or the way of conceiving the subject, is the one
that makes the novel step in thought. This is, to be sure,
not always the case; for the fact that M carries P with it
may also be unfamiliar and now formulated for the first
time.</p>

<p>The perception that S is M is a <i>mode of conceiving S</i>.
The statement that M is P is an <i>abstract or general proposition</i>.
A word about both is necessary.</p>


<h4>WHAT IS MEANT BY A MODE OF CONCEIVING.</h4>


<p>When we conceive of S merely as M (of vermilion
merely as a mercury-compound, for example), we neglect
all the other attributes which it may have, and attend
exclusively to this one. We mutilate the fulness of
S's reality. Every reality has an infinity of aspects or
properties. Even so simple a fact as a line which you trace
in the air may be considered in respect to its form, its
length, its direction, and its location. When we reach
more complex facts, the number of ways in which we may
regard them is literally endless. Vermilion is not only a
mercury-compound, it is vividly red, heavy, and expensive,
it comes from China, and so on, <i>in infinitum</i>. All objects are
well-springs of properties, which are only little by little
developed to our knowledge, and it is truly said that to
know one thing thoroughly would be to know the whole
universe. Mediately or immediately, that one thing is related
to everything else; and to know <i>all</i> about it, all its
relations need be known. But each relation forms one of
its attributes, one angle by which some one may conceive it,
and while so conceiving it may ignore the rest of it. A man
is such a complex fact. But out of the complexity all that
an army commissary picks out as important for his purposes
is his property of eating so many pounds a day; the general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
of marching so many miles; the chair-maker, of having
such a shape; the orator, of responding to such and such
feelings; the theatre-manager, of being willing to pay just
such a price, and no more, for an evening's amusement.
Each of these persons singles out the particular side of the
entire man which has a bearing on <i>his</i> concerns, and not till
this side is distinctly and separately conceived can the
proper practical conclusions <i>for that reasoner</i> be drawn; and
when they are drawn the man's other attributes may be ignored.</p>

<p>All ways of conceiving a concrete fact, if they are true
ways at all, are equally true ways. <i>There is no property</i>
<span class="smcap">absolutely</span> <i>essential to any one thing</i>. The same property
which figures as the essence of a thing on one occasion becomes
a very inessential feature upon another. Now that
I am writing, it is essential that I conceive my paper as a
surface for inscription. If I failed to do that, I should have
to stop my work. But if I wished to light a fire, and no
other materials were by, the essential way of conceiving
the paper would be as combustible material; and I need
then have no thought of any of its other destinations. It is
really <i>all</i> that it is: a combustible, a writing surface, a thin
thing, a hydrocarbonaceous thing, a thing eight inches one
way and ten another, a thing just one furlong east of a certain
stone in my neighbor's field, an American thing, etc., etc.,
<i>ad infinitum</i>. Whichever one of these aspects of its being I
temporarily class it under, makes me unjust to the other
aspects. But as I always am classing it under one aspect
or another, I am always unjust, always partial, always exclusive.
My excuse is necessity&mdash;the necessity which my
finite and practical nature lays upon me. My thinking is
first and last and always for the sake of my doing, and I
can only do one thing at a time. A God, who is supposed
to drive the whole universe abreast, may also be supposed,
without detriment to his activity, to see all parts of it at
once and without emphasis. But were our human attention
so to disperse itself we should simply stare vacantly at
things at large and forfeit our opportunity of doing any
particular act. Mr. Warner, in his Adirondack story, shot a
bear by aiming, not at his eye or heart, but 'at him generally.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
But we cannot aim 'generally' at the universe;
or if we do, we miss our game. Our scope is narrow, and
we must attack things piecemeal, ignoring the solid fulness
in which the elements of Nature exist, and stringing one
after another of them together in a serial way, to suit our
little interests as they change from hour to hour. In this,
the partiality of one moment is partly atoned for by the
different sort of partiality of the next. To me now, writing
these words, emphasis and selection seem to be the essence
of the human mind. In other chapters other qualities have
seemed, and will again seem, more important parts of psychology.</p>

<p>Men are so ingrainedly partial that, for common-sense
and scholasticism (which is only common-sense grown articulate),
the notion that there is no one quality genuinely,
absolutely, and exclusively essential to anything is almost
unthinkable. "A thing's essence makes it <i>what</i> it is. Without
an exclusive essence it would be nothing in particular,
would be quite nameless, we could not say it was this
rather than that. What you write on, for example,&mdash;why
talk of its being combustible, rectangular, and the like,
when you know that these are mere accidents, and that
what it really is, and was made to be, is just <i>paper</i> and
nothing else?" The reader is pretty sure to make some
such comment as this. But he is himself merely insisting
on an aspect of the thing which suits his own petty purpose,
that of <i>naming</i> the thing; or else on an aspect which suits
the manufacturer's purpose, that of <i>producing an article
for which there is a vulgar demand</i>. Meanwhile the reality
overflows these purposes at every pore. Our usual purpose
with it, our commonest title for it, and the properties which
this title suggests, have in reality nothing sacramental.
They characterize <i>us</i> more than they characterize the thing.
But we are so stuck in our prejudices, so petrified intellectually,
that to our vulgarest names, with their suggestions,
we ascribe an eternal and exclusive worth. The thing must
be, essentially, what the vulgarest name connotes; what
less usual names connote, it can be only in an 'accidental'
and relatively unreal sense.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>
<p>Locke undermined the fallacy. But none of his successors,
so far as I know, have radically escaped it, or seen
that <i>the only meaning of essence is teleological, and that classification
and conception are purely teleological weapons of the
mind</i>. The essence of a thing is that one of its properties
which is so <i>important for my interests</i> that in comparison
with it I may neglect the rest. Amongst those other things
which have this important property I class it, after this
property I name it, as a thing endowed with this property
I conceive it; and whilst so classing, naming, and conceiving
it, all other truths about it become to me as naught.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
The properties which are important vary from man to man
and from hour to hour.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Hence divers appellations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
conceptions for the same thing. But many objects of daily
use&mdash;as paper, ink, butter, horse-car&mdash;have properties of
such constant unwavering importance, and have such stereotyped
names, that we end by believing that to conceive
them in those ways is to conceive them in the only true
way. Those are no truer ways of conceiving them than any
others; they are only more important ways, more frequently
serviceable ways.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>
<p>So much for what is implied, when the reasoner conceives
of the fact S before him as a case of which the essence
is to be M. One word now as to what is involved in M's
having properties, consequences, or implications, and we
can go back to the study of the reasoning process again.</p>


<h4>WHAT IS INVOLVED IN GENERAL PROPOSITIONS.</h4>


<p>M is not a concrete, or 'self-sufficient,' as Mr. Clay
would say. It is an abstract character which may exist,
embedded with other characters, in many concretes. Whether
it be the character of being a writing surface, of being
made in America or China, of being eight inches square, or
of being in a certain part of space, this is always true of it.
Now we might conceive of this being a world in which all
such general characters were independent of each other, so
that if any one of them were found in a subject S, we never
could be sure what others would be found alongside of it.
On one occasion there might be P with M, on another Q,
and so on. In such a world there would be no <i>general</i>
sequences or coexistences, and no universal laws. Each
grouping would be <i>sui generis</i>; from the experience of the
past no future could be predicted; and reasoning, as we
shall presently see, would be an impossibility.</p>

<p>But the world we live in is not one of this sort. Though
many general characters seem indifferent to each other,
there remain a number of them which affect constant habits
of mutual concomitance or repugnance. They involve or
imply each other. One of them is a sign to us that the
other will be found. They hunt in couples, as it were; and
such a proposition as that M is P, or includes P, or precedes
or accompanies P, if it prove to be true in one instance,
may very likely be true in every other instance which we
meet. This is, in fact, a world in which general laws obtain,
in which universal propositions <i>are</i> true, and in which reasoning
is therefore possible. Fortunately for us: for since
we cannot handle things as wholes, but only by conceiving
them through some general character which for the time
we call their essence, it would be a great pity if the matter
ended there, and if the general character, once picked out
and in our possession, helped us to no farther advance. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
<a href="#CHAPTER_XXVIII">Chapter XXVIII</a> we shall have again to consider this harmony
between our reasoning faculty and the world in which
its lot is cast.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>To revert now to our symbolic representation of the
reasoning process:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">M is P</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">S is M</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">S is P</span><br />
</p>

<p>M is discerned and picked out for the time being to be
the essence of the concrete fact, phenomenon, or reality, S.
But M in this world of ours is inevitably conjoined with P;
so that P is the next thing that we may expect to find conjoined
with the fact S. We may conclude or infer P,
through the intermediation of the M which our sagacity
began by discerning, when S came before it, to be the
essence of the case.</p>

<p>Now note that if P have any value or importance for us,
M was a very good character for our sagacity to pounce upon
and abstract. If, on the contrary, P were of no importance,
some other character than M would have been a better
essence for us to conceive of S by. Psychologically, as a
rule, P overshadows the process from the start. We are
<i>seeking</i> P, or something like P. But the bare totality of S
does not yield it to our gaze; and casting about for some
point in S to take hold of, which will lead us to P, we hit,
if we are sagacious, upon M, because M happens to be just
the character which is knit up with P. Had we wished Q
instead of P, and were N a property of S conjoined with Q,
we ought to have ignored M, noticed N, and conceived of S
as a sort of N exclusively.</p>

<p>Reasoning is always for a subjective interest, to attain
some particular conclusion, or to gratify some special
curiosity. It not only breaks up the datum placed before
it and conceives it abstractly; it must conceive it <i>rightly</i>
too; and conceiving it rightly means conceiving it by that
one particular abstract character which leads to the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
sort of conclusion which it is the reasoner's temporary interest
to attain.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The <i>results</i> of reasoning may be hit upon by accident,
The stereoscope was actually a result of reasoning; it is
conceivable, however, that a man playing with pictures and
mirrors might accidentally have hit upon it. Cats have been
known to open doors by pulling latches, etc. But no cat,
if the latch got out of order, could open the door again,
unless some new accident of random fumbling taught her
to associate some new total movement with the total phenomenon
of the closed door. A reasoning man, however,
would open the door by first analyzing the hindrance. He
would ascertain what particular feature of the door was
wrong. The lever, e.g., does not raise the latch sufficiently
from its slot&mdash;case of insufficient elevation&mdash;raise door
bodily on hinges! Or door sticks at top by friction against
lintel&mdash;press it bodily down! Now it is obvious that a
child or an idiot might without this reasoning learn the <i>rule</i>
for opening that particular door. I remember a clock which
the maid-servant had discovered would not go unless it
were supported so as to tilt slightly forwards. She had
stumbled on this method after many weeks of groping. The
reason of the stoppage was the friction of the pendulum-bob
against the back of the clock-case, a reason which an
educated man would have analyzed out in five minutes. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
have a student's lamp of which the flame vibrates most unpleasantly
unless the collar which bears the chimney be
raised about a sixteenth of an inch. I learned the remedy
after much torment by accident, and now always keep the
collar up with a small wedge. But my procedure is a mere
association of two totals, diseased object and remedy. One
learned in pneumatics could have named the <i>cause</i> of the
disease, and thence inferred the remedy immediately. By
many measurements of triangles one might find their area
always equal to their height multiplied by half their base,
and one might formulate an empirical law to that effect.
But a reasoner saves himself all this trouble by seeing that
it is the essence (<i>pro hac vice</i>) of a triangle to be the half of
a parallelogram whose area is the height into the entire
base. To see this he must invent additional lines; and the
geometer must often draw such to get at the essential property
he may require in a figure. The essence consists in
some <i>relation of the figure to the new lines</i>, a relation not obvious
at all until they are put in. The geometer's sagacity
lies in the invention of the new lines.</p>


<h4>THUS, THERE ARE TWO GREAT POINTS IN REASONING:</h4>


<p><i>First, an extracted character is taken as equivalent to the
entire datum from which it comes; and,</i></p>

<p><i>Second, the character thus taken suggests a certain consequence
more obviously than it was suggested by the total datum
as it originally came.</i> Take them again, successively.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. Suppose I say, when offered a piece of cloth, "I won't
buy that; it looks as if it would fade," meaning merely
that something about it suggests the idea of fading to my
mind,&mdash;my judgment, though possibly correct, is not reasoned,
but purely empirical; but, if I can say that into the
color there enters a certain dye which I know to be chemically
unstable, and that <i>therefore</i> the color will fade, my judgment
is reasoned. The notion of the dye which is one of the
parts of the cloth, is the connecting link between the latter
and the notion of fading. So, again, an uneducated man
will expect from past experience to see a piece of ice melt
if placed near the fire, and the tip of his finger look coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
if he views it through a convex glass. In neither of these
cases could the result be anticipated without full previous
acquaintance with the entire phenomenon. It is not a
result of reasoning.</p>

<p>But a man who should conceive heat as a mode of
motion, and liquefaction as identical with increased motion
of molecules; who should know that curved surfaces bend
light-rays in special ways, and that the apparent size of
anything is connected with the amount of the 'bend' of its
light-rays as they enter the eye,&mdash;such a man would make
the right inferences for all these objects, even though he
had never in his life had any concrete experience of them;
and he would do this because the ideas which we have
above supposed him to possess would mediate in his mind
between the phenomena he starts with and the conclusions
he draws. But these ideas or reasons for his conclusions
are all mere extracted portions or circumstances singled
out from the mass of characters which make up the entire
phenomena. The motions which form heat, the bending
of the light-waves, are, it is true, excessively recondite
ingredients; the hidden pendulum I spoke of above is less
so; and the sticking of a door on its sill in the earlier example
would hardly be so at all. But each and all agree
in this, that they bear a <i>more evident relation</i> to the conclusion
than did the immediate data in their full totality.</p>

<p>The difficulty is, in each case, to extract from the immediate
data that particular ingredient which shall have
this very evident relation to the conclusion. Every phenomenon
or so-called 'fact' has an infinity of aspects or
properties, as we have seen, amongst which the fool, or
man with little sagacity, will inevitably go astray. But no
matter for this point now. The first thing is to have seen
that every possible case of reasoning involves the extraction
of a particular partial aspect of the phenomena thought
about, and that whilst Empirical Thought simply associates
phenomena in their entirety, Reasoned Thought couples
them by the conscious use of this extract.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. And, now, to prove the second point: Why are the
couplings, consequences, and implications of extracts more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
evident and obvious than those of entire phenomena? For
two reasons.</p>

<p>First, the extracted characters are more general than
the concretes, and the connections they may have are,
therefore, more familiar to us, having been more often
met in our experience. Think of heat as motion, and whatever
is true of motion will be true of heat; but we have had
a hundred experiences of motion for every one of heat.
Think of the rays passing through this lens as bending
towards the perpendicular, and you substitute for the comparatively
unfamiliar lens the very familiar notion of a particular
change in direction of a line, of which notion every
day brings us countless examples.</p>

<p>The other reason why the relations of the extracted
characters are so evident is that their properties are so
<i>few</i>, compared with the properties of the whole, from which
we derived them. In every concrete total the characters
and their consequences are so inexhaustibly numerous
that we may lose our way among them before noticing
the particular consequence it behooves us to draw. But,
if we are lucky enough to single out the proper character,
we take in, as it were, by a single glance all its possible
consequences. Thus the character of scraping the sill
has very few suggestions, prominent among which is the
suggestion that the scraping will cease if we raise the door;
whilst the entire refractory door suggests an enormous number
of notions to the mind.</p>

<p>Take another example. I am sitting in a railroad-car,
waiting for the train to start. It is winter, and the stove
fills the car with pungent smoke. The brakeman enters,
and my neighbor asks him to "stop that stove smoking."
He replies that it will stop entirely as soon as the car begins
to move. "Why so?" asks the passenger. "It <i>always</i>
does," replies the brakeman. It is evident from this
'always' that the connection between car moving and
smoke stopping was a purely empirical one in the brakeman's
mind, bred of habit. But, if the passenger had been
an acute reasoner, he, with no experience of what that stove
always did, might have anticipated the brakeman's reply,
and spared his own question. Had he singled out of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
numerous points involved in a stove's not smoking the one
special point of smoke pouring freely out of the stove-pipe's
mouth, he would, probably, owing to the few associations
of that idea, have been immediately reminded of the law
that a fluid passes more rapidly out of a pipe's mouth if
another fluid be at the same time streaming over that
mouth; and then the rapid draught of air over the stove-pipe's
mouth, which is one of the points involved in the
car's motion, would immediately have occurred to him.</p>

<p>Thus a couple of extracted characters, with a couple of
their few and obvious connections, would have formed the
reasoned link in the passenger's mind between the phenomena,
smoke stopping and car moving, which were only linked
as wholes in the brakeman's mind. Such examples may seem
trivial, but they contain the essence of the most refined and
transcendental theorizing. The reason why physics grows
more deductive the more the fundamental properties it assumes
are of a mathematical sort, such as molecular mass
or wave-length, is that the immediate consequences of these
notions are so few that we can survey them all at once, and
promptly pick out those which concern us.</p>


<h4><i>Sagacity; or the Perception of the Essence.</i></h4>


<p>To reason, then, we must be able to extract characters,&mdash;not
<i>any</i> characters, but the right characters for our conclusion.
If we extract the wrong character, it will not lead to
that conclusion. Here, then, is the difficulty: <i>How are
characters extracted, and why does it require the advent of a
genius in many cases before the fitting character is brought to
light?</i> Why cannot anybody reason as well as anybody
else? Why does it need a Newton to notice the law of the
squares, a Darwin to notice the survival of the fittest? To
answer these questions we must begin a new research, and
see how our insight into facts naturally grows.</p>

<p>All our knowledge at first is vague. When we say that
a thing is vague, we mean that it has no subdivisions <i>ab intra</i>,
nor precise limitations <i>ab extra</i>; but still all the forms
of thought may apply to it. It may have unity, reality, externality,
extent, and what not&mdash;<i>thinghood</i>, in a word, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
thinghood only as a whole.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> In this vague way, probably,
does the room appear to the babe who first begins to be
conscious of it as something other than his moving nurse.
It has no subdivisions in his mind, unless, perhaps, the
window is able to attract his separate notice. In this vague
way, certainly, does every entirely new experience appear
to the adult. A library, a museum, a machine-shop, are
mere confused wholes to the uninstructed, but the machinist,
the antiquary, and the bookworm perhaps hardly notice
the whole at all, so eager are they to pounce upon the
details. Familiarity has in them bred discrimination.
Such vague terms as 'grass,' 'mould,' and 'meat' do not
exist for the botanist or the anatomist. They know too
much about grasses, moulds, and muscles. A certain person
said to Charles Kingsley, who was showing him the dissection
of a caterpillar, with its exquisite viscera, "Why, I
thought it was nothing but skin and squash!" A layman
present at a shipwreck, a battle, or a fire is helpless. Discrimination
has been so little awakened in him by experience
that his consciousness leaves no single point of the
complex situation accented and standing out for him to begin
to act upon. But the sailor, the fireman, and the general
know directly at what corner to take up the business.
They 'see into the situation'&mdash;that is, they analyze it&mdash;with
their first glance. It is full of delicately differenced ingredients
which their education has little by little brought to
their consciousness, but of which the novice gains no clear
idea.</p>

<p>How this power of analysis was brought about we saw
in our chapters on Discrimination and Attention. We dissociate
the elements of originally vague totals by attending
to them or noticing them alternately, of course. But what
determines which element we shall attend to first? There
are two immediate and obvious answers: first, our practical
or instinctive interests; and, second, our æsthetic interests.
The dog singles out of any situation its smells, and the horse
its sounds, because they may reveal facts of practical moment,
and are instinctively exciting to these several creatures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
The infant notices the candle-flame or the window,
and ignores the rest of the room, because those objects give
him a vivid pleasure. So, the country boy dissociates the
blackberry, the chestnut, and the wintergreen, from the
vague mass of other shrubs and trees, for their practical
uses, and the savage is delighted with the beads, the bits of
looking-glass, brought by an exploring vessel, and gives no
heed to the features of the vessel itself, which is too much
beyond his sphere. These æsthetic and practical interests,
then, are the weightiest factors in making particular ingredients
stand out in high relief. What they lay their accent
on, that we notice; but what they are in themselves, we cannot
say. We must content ourselves here with simply accepting
them as irreducible ultimate factors in determining
the way our knowledge grows.</p>

<p>Now, a creature which has few instinctive impulses, or
interests, practical or æsthetic, will dissociate few characters,
and will, at best, have limited reasoning powers;
whilst one whose interests are very varied will reason much
better. Man, by his immensely varied instincts, practical
wants, and æsthetic feelings, to which every sense contributes,
would, by dint of these alone, be sure to dissociate
vastly more characters than any other animal; and accordingly
we find that the lowest savages reason incomparably
better than the highest brutes. The diverse interests lead,
too, to a diversification of experiences, whose accumulation
becomes a condition for the play of that <i>law of dissociation
by varying concomitants</i> of which I treated in a former chapter
(see Vol I. p. 506).</p>


<h4><i>The Help given by Association by Similarity.</i></h4>


<p>It is probable, also, that man's <i>superior association by
similarity</i> has much to do with those discriminations of
character on which his higher flights of reasoning are based.
As this latter is an important matter, and as little or nothing
was said of it in the chapter on Discrimination, it behooves
me to dwell a little upon it here.</p>

<p>What does the reader do when he wishes to see in what
the precise likeness or difference of two objects lies? He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
transfers his attention as rapidly as possible, backwards
and forwards, from one to the other. The rapid alteration
in consciousness shakes out, as it were, the points of difference
or agreement, which would have slumbered forever
unnoticed if the consciousness of the objects compared had
occurred at widely distant periods of time. What does
the scientific man do who searches for the reason or law
embedded in a phenomenon? He deliberately accumulates
all the instances he can find which have any analogy
to that phenomenon; and, by simultaneously filling his
mind with them all, he frequently succeeds in detaching
from the collection the peculiarity which he was unable
to formulate in one alone; even though that one had been
preceded in his former experience by all of those with
which he now at once confronts it. These examples show
that the mere general fact of having occurred at some time
in one's experience, with varying concomitants, is not by
itself a sufficient reason for a character to be dissociated
now. We need something more; we need that the varying
concomitants should in all their variety be brought into
consciousness <i>at once</i>. Not till then will the character in
question escape from its adhesion to each and all of them
and stand alone. This will immediately be recognized by
those who have read Mill's Logic as the ground of Utility
in his famous 'four methods of experimental inquiry,' the
methods of agreement, of difference, of residues, and of
concomitant variations. Each of these gives a list of
analogous instances out of the midst of which a sought-for
character may roll and strike the mind.</p>

<p>Now it is obvious that any mind in which association by
similarity is highly developed is a mind which will spontaneously
form lists of instances like this. Take a present
case A, with a character <i>m</i> in it. The mind may fail at first
to notice this character <i>m</i> at all. But if A calls up C, D,
E, and F,&mdash;these being phenomena which resemble A in
possessing <i>m</i>, but which may not have entered for months
into the experience of the animal who now experiences A,
why, plainly, such association performs the part of the
reader's deliberately rapid comparison referred to above,
and of the systematic consideration of like cases by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
scientific investigator, and may lead to the noticing of <i>m</i>
in an abstract way. Certainly this is obvious; and no
conclusion is left to us but to assert that, after the few
most powerful practical and æsthetic interests, our chief
help towards noticing those special characters of phenomena,
which, when once possessed and named, are used as
reasons, class names, essences, or middle terms, <i>is this
association by similarity.</i> Without it, indeed, the deliberate
procedure of the scientific man would be impossible: he
could never collect his analogous instances. But it operates
of itself in highly-gifted minds without any deliberation,
spontaneously collecting analogous instances, uniting
in a moment what in nature the whole breadth of space and
time keeps separate, and so permitting a perception of
identical points in the midst of different circumstances,
which minds governed wholly by the law of contiguity
could never begin to attain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/fig_80.jpg" width="300" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 80.</div>
</div>

<p>Figure 80 shows this. If <i>m</i>, in the present representation
A, calls up B, C, D, and E, which are similar to A in
possessing it, and calls them up in rapid succession, then
<i>m</i>, being associated almost simultaneously with such varying
concomitants, will 'roll out' and attract our separate
notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>If so much is clear to the reader, he will be willing to
admit that the mind <i>in which this mode of association most
prevails</i> will, from its better opportunity of extricating
characters, be the one most prone to reasoned thinking;
whilst, on the other hand, a mind in which we do not
detect reasoned thinking will probably be one in which
association by contiguity holds almost exclusive sway.</p>

<p>Geniuses are, by common consent, considered to differ
from ordinary minds by an unusual development of association
by similarity. One of Professor Bain's best strokes of
work is the exhibition of this truth.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> It applies to geniuses
in the line of reasoning as well as in other lines. And as the
genius is to the vulgarian, so the vulgar human mind is to
the intelligence of a brute. Compared with men, it is
probable that brutes neither attend to abstract characters,
nor have associations by similarity. Their thoughts probably
pass from one concrete object to its habitual concrete
successor far more uniformly than is the case with us. In
other words, their associations of ideas are almost exclusively
by contiguity. It will clear up still farther our
understanding of the reasoning process, if we devote a few
pages to</p>


<h4>THE INTELLECTUAL CONTRAST BETWEEN BRUTE AND MAN.</h4>


<p>I will first try to show, by taking the best stories I can
find of animal sagacity, that the mental process involved
may as a rule be perfectly accounted for by mere contiguous
association, based on experience. Mr. Darwin, in his
'Descent of Man,' instances the Arctic dogs, described by
Dr. Hayes, who scatter, when drawing a sledge, as soon as
the ice begins to crack. This might be called by some an
exercise of reason. The test would be, Would the most
intelligent Eskimo dogs that ever lived act so when placed
upon ice for the first time together? A band of men from
the tropics might do so easily. Recognizing cracking to
be a sign of breaking, and seizing immediately the partial
character that the point of rupture is the point of greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
strain, and that the massing of weight at a given point concentrates
there the strain, a Hindoo might quickly infer that
scattering would stop the cracking, and, by crying out to
his comrades to disperse, save the party from immersion.
But in the dog's case we need only suppose that they
have individually experienced wet skins after cracking, that
they have often noticed cracking to begin when they were
huddled together, and that they have observed it to cease
when they scattered. Naturally, therefore, the sound would
redintegrate all these former experiences, including that of
scattering, which latter they would promptly renew. It
would be a case of immediate suggestion or of that 'Logic
of Recepts' as Mr. Romanes calls it, of which we spoke
above on <a href="#Page_327">p. 327</a>.</p>

<p>A friend of the writer gave as a proof of the almost
human intelligence of his dog that he took him one day
down to his boat on the shore, but found the boat full of
dirt and water. He remembered that the sponge was up at
the house, a third of a mile distant; but, disliking to go back
himself, he made various gestures of wiping out the boat
and so forth, saying to his terrier, "Sponge, sponge; go
fetch the sponge." But he had little expectation of a result,
since the dog had never received the slightest training with
the boat or the sponge. Nevertheless, off he trotted to the
house, and, to his owner's great surprise and admiration,
brought the sponge in his jaws. Sagacious as this was, it
required nothing but ordinary contiguous association of
ideas. The terrier was only exceptional in the minuteness
of his spontaneous observation. Most terriers would have
taken no interest in the boat-cleaning operation, nor noticed
what the sponge was for. This terrier, in having
picked those details out of the crude mass of his boat-experience
distinctly enough to be reminded of them, was truly
enough ahead of his peers on the line which leads to human
reason. But his act was not yet an act of reasoning proper.
It might fairly have been called so if, unable to find the
sponge at the house, he had brought back a dipper or a
mop instead. Such a substitution would have shown that,
embedded in the very different appearances of these articles,
he had been able to discriminate the identical partial attribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
of capacity to take up water, and had reflected, "For
the present purpose they are identical." This, which the
dog did not do, any man but the very stupidest could not
fail to do.</p>

<p>If the reader will take the trouble to analyze the best
dog and elephant stories he knows, he will find that, in most
cases, this simple contiguous calling up of one whole by
another is quite sufficient to explain the phenomena.
Sometimes, it is true, we have to suppose the recognition of
a property or character as such, but it is then always a character
which the peculiar practical interests of the animal
may have singled out. A dog, noticing his master's hat on its
peg, may possibly infer that he has not gone out. Intelligent
dogs recognize by the tone of the master's voice whether
the latter is angry or not. A dog will perceive whether
you have kicked him by accident or by design, and behave
accordingly. The character inferred by him, the particular
mental state in you, however it be represented in his
mind&mdash;it is represented probably by a 'recept' (<a href="#Page_327">p. 327</a>) or
set of practical tendencies, rather than by a definite concept
or idea&mdash;is still a partial character extracted from the
totality of your phenomenal being, and is his reason for
crouching and skulking, or playing with you. Dogs, moreover,
seem to have the feeling of the value of their master's
personal property, or at least a particular <i>interest</i> in objects
which their master uses. A dog left with his master's coat
will defend it, though never taught to do so. I know of a
dog accustomed to swim after sticks in the water, but who
always refused to dive for stones. Nevertheless, when a fish-basket,
which he had never been trained to carry, but merely
knew as his master's, fell over, he immediately dived after
it and brought it up. Dogs thus discern, at any rate so far
as to be able to act, this partial character of <i>being valuable</i>,
which lies hidden in certain things.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Stories are told of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
dogs carrying coppers to pastry-cooks to get buns, and it is
said that a certain dog, if he gave two coppers, would never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
leave without two buns. This was probably mere contiguous
association, but it is <i>possible</i> that the animal noticed
the character of duality, and identified it as the same
in the coin and the cake. If so, it is the maximum of
canine abstract thinking. Another story told to the writer
is this: a dog was sent to a lumber-camp to fetch a wedge,
with which he was known to be acquainted. After half an
hour, not returning, he was sought and found biting and
tugging at the handle of an axe which was driven deeply
into a stump. The wedge could not be found. The teller
of the story thought that the dog must have had a clear
perception of the common character of serving to split
which was involved in both the instruments, and, from their
identity in this respect, inferred their identity for the purposes
required.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that this interpretation is a possible
one, but it seems to me far to transcend the limits of ordinary
canine abstraction. The property in question was not
one which had direct personal interest for the dog, such
as that of belonging to his master is in the case of the
coat or the basket. If the dog in the sponge story had returned
to the boat with a dipper it would have been no
more remarkable. It seems more probable, therefore, that
this wood-cutter's dog had also been accustomed to carry
the axe, and now, excited by the vain hunt for the wedge,
had discharged his carrying powers upon the former instrument
in a sort of confusion&mdash;just as a man may pick up a
sieve to carry water in, in the excitement of putting out a
fire.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus, then, the characters extracted by animals are
very few, and always related to their immediate interests
or emotions. That dissociation by varying concomitants,
which in man is based so largely on association by similarity,
hardly seems to take place at all in the mind of brutes.
One total thought suggests to them another total thought,
and they find themselves acting with propriety, they know
not why. The great, the fundamental, defect of their minds
seems to be the inability of their groups of ideas to break
across in unaccustomed places. They are enslaved to
routine, to cut-and-dried thinking; and if the most prosaic
of human beings could be transported into his dog's mind,
he would be appalled at the utter absence of fancy which
reigns there.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Thoughts will not be found to call up their
similars, but only their habitual successors. Sunsets will
not suggest heroes' deaths, but supper-time. This is why
man is the only metaphysical animal. To wonder why the
universe should be as it is presupposes the notion of its being
different, and a brute, which never reduces the actual to
fluidity by breaking up its literal sequences in his imagination,
can never form such a notion. He takes the world
simply for granted, and never wonders at it at all.</p>

<p>Professor Strümpell quotes a dog-story which is probably
a type of many others. The feat performed looks like
abstract reasoning; but an acquaintance with all the circumstances
shows it to have been a random trick learned
by habit. The story is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have two dogs, a small, long-legged pet dog and a rather large
watch-dog. Immediately beyond the house-court is the garden, into
which one enters through a low lattice-gate which is closed by a latch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
on the yard-side. This latch is opened by lifting it. Besides this,
moreover, the gate is fastened on the garden-side by a string nailed to
the gate-post. Here, as often as one wished, could the following sight
be observed. If the little dog was shut in the garden and he wished to
get out, he placed himself before the gate and barked. Immediately
the large dog in the court would hasten to him and raise the latch with
his nose while the little dog on the garden-side leaped up and, catching
the string in his teeth, bit it through; whereupon the big one wedged
his snout between the gate and the post, pushed the gate open, and the
little dog slipped through. Certainly reasoning seems here to prevail.
In face of it, however, and although the dogs arrived of themselves, and
without human aid, at their solution of the gate question, I am able to
point out that the complete action was pieced together out of accidental
experiences which the dogs followed, I might say, unconsciously. While
the large dog was young, he was allowed, like the little one, to go into
the garden, and therefore the gate was usually not latched, but simply
closed. Now if he saw anyone go in, he would follow by thrusting his
snout between gate and post, and so pushing the gate open. When he
was grown I forbade his being taken in, and had the gate kept latched.
But he naturally still tried to follow when anyone entered and tried in
the old fashion to open it, which he could no longer do. Now it fell
out that once, while making the attempt, he raised his nose higher than
usual and hit the latch from below so as to lift it off its hook, and the
gate unclosed. From thenceforth he made the same movement of the
head when trying to open it, and, of course, with the same result. He
now knew how to open the gate when it was latched.</p>

<p>"The little dog had been the large one's teacher in many things,
especially in the chasing of cats and the catching of mice and moles; so
when the little one was heard barking eagerly, the other always hastened
to him. If the barking came from the garden, he opened the gate
to get inside. But meanwhile the little dog, who wanted to get out the
moment the gate opened, slipped out between the big one's legs, and so
the appearance of his having come with the intention of letting him out
arose. And that it was simply an appearance transpired from the fact
that when the little dog did not succeed at once in getting out, the large
one ran in and nosed about the garden, plainly showing that he had expected
to find something there. In order to stop this opening of the
gate I fastened a string on the garden-side which, tightly drawn, held
the gate firm against the post, so that if the yard dog raised the latch
and let go, it would every time fall back on to the hook. And this
device was successful for quite a time, until it happened one day that
on my return from a walk upon which the little dog had accompanied
me I crossed the garden, and in passing through the gate the dog remained
behind, and refused to come to my whistle. As it was beginning
to rain, and I knew how he disliked to get wet, I closed the gate
in order to punish him in this manner. But I had hardly readied the
house ere he was before the gate, whining and crying most piteously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
for the rain was falling faster and faster. The big dog, to whom the
rain was a matter of perfect indifference, was instantly on hand and
tried his utmost to open the gate, but naturally without success. Almost
in despair the little dog bit at the gate, at the same time springing
into the air in the attempt to jump over it, when he chanced to catch
the string in his teeth; it broke, and the gate flew open. Now he
knew the secret and thenceforth bit the string whenever he wished to
get out, so that I was obliged to change it.</p>

<p>"That the big dog in raising the latch did not in the least <i>know</i> that
the latch closed the gate, that the raising of the same opened it, but that
he merely repeated the automatic blow with his snout which had once
had such happy consequences, transpires from the following: the gate
leading to the barn is fastened with a latch precisely like the one on
the garden-gate, only placed a little higher, still easily within the dog's
reach. Here, too, occasionally the little dog is confined, and when he
barks the big one makes every possible effort to open the gate, but it
has never occurred to him to push the latch up. The brute cannot
draw conclusions, that is, he cannot think."<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Other classical <i>differentiæ</i> of man besides that of being
the only reasoning animal, also seem consequences of his
unrivalled powers of similar association. He has, e.g., been
called 'the laughing animal.' But humor has often been
defined as the recognition of identities in things different.
When the man in Coriolanus says of that hero that "there
is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger,"
both the invention of the phrase and its enjoyment by the
hearer depend on a peculiarly perplexing power to associate
ideas by similarity.</p>

<p>Man is known again as 'the talking animal'; and language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
is assuredly a capital distinction between man and
brute. But it may readily be shown how this distinction
merely flows from those we have pointed out, easy dissociation
of a representation into its ingredients, and association
by similarity.</p>

<p>Language is a system of <i>signs</i>, different from the things
signified, but able to suggest them.</p>

<p>No doubt brutes have a number of such signs. When
a dog yelps in front of a door, and his master, understanding
his desire, opens it, the dog may, after a certain number
of repetitions, get to repeat in cold blood a yelp which was
at first the involuntary interjectional expression of strong
emotion. The same dog may be taught to 'beg' for food,
and afterwards come to do so deliberately when hungry.
The dog also learns to understand the signs of men, and
the word 'rat' uttered to a terrier suggests exciting
thoughts of the rat-hunt. If the dog had the varied impulse
to vocal utterance which some other animals have,
he would probably repeat the word 'rat' whenever he
spontaneously happened to think of a rat-hunt&mdash;he no
doubt does have it as an auditory image, just as a parrot
calls out different words spontaneously from its repertory,
and having learned the name of a given dog will utter it on
the sight of a different dog. In each of these separate cases
the particular sign <i>may</i> be consciously noticed by the animal,
as distinct from the particular thing signified, and will
thus, so far as it goes, be a true manifestation of language.
But when we come to man we find a great difference. <i>He
has a deliberate intention to apply a sign to everything.</i> The
linguistic impulse is with him generalized and systematic.
For things hitherto unnoticed or unfelt, he <i>desires</i> a sign
before he has one. Even though the dog should possess
his 'yelp' for this thing, his 'beg' for that, and his auditory
image 'rat' for a third thing, the matter with him rests
there. If a fourth thing interests him for which no sign
happens already to have been learned, he remains tranquilly
without it and goes no further. But the man <i>postulates</i>
it, its absence irritates him, and he ends by inventing
it. <i>This</i> <span class="smcap">general purpose</span> <i>constitutes, I take it, the peculiarity
of human speech, and explains its prodigious development.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>
<p>How, then, does the general purpose arise? It arises
as soon as the notion of a <i>sign as such</i>, apart from any particular
import, is born; and this notion is born by dissociation
from the outstanding portions of a number of
concrete cases of signification. The 'yelp,' the 'beg,' the
'rat,' differ as to their several imports and natures. They
agree only in so far as they have the same <i>use</i>&mdash;to <i>be signs</i>,
to stand for something more important than themselves.
The dog whom this similarity could strike would have
grasped the sign <i>per se</i> as such, and would probably
thereupon become a general sign-maker, or speaker in
the human sense. But how can the similarity strike
him? Not without the juxtaposition of the similars (in
virtue of the law we have laid down (Vol. I. p. 506), that in order
to be segregated an experience must be repeated with
varying concomitants)&mdash;not unless the 'yelp' of the dog
at the moment it occurs <i>recalls</i> to him his 'beg,' by the
delicate bond of their subtle similarity of use&mdash;not till
then can this thought flash through his mind: "Why, yelp
and beg, in spite of all their unlikeness, are yet alike in
this: that they are actions, signs, which lead to important
boons. Other boons, <i>any</i> boons, may then be got by other
signs!" This reflection made, the gulf is passed. Animals
probably never make it, because the bond of similarity is
not delicate enough. Each sign is drowned in <i>its</i> import,
and never awakens other signs and other imports in juxtaposition.
The rat-hunt idea is too absorbingly interesting
in itself to be interrupted by anything so uncontiguous
to it as the idea of the 'beg for food,' or of 'the door-open
yelp,' nor in their turn do these awaken the rat-hunt idea.</p>

<p>In the human child, however, these ruptures of contiguous
association are very soon made; far off cases of sign-using
arise when we make a sign now; and soon language
is launched. The child in each case makes the discovery
for himself. No one can help him except by furnishing
him with the conditions. But as he is constituted, the conditions
will sooner or later shoot together into the result.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>
<p>The exceedingly interesting account which Dr. Howe
gives of the education of his various blind-deaf mutes illustrates
this point admirably. He began to teach Laura
Bridgman by gumming raised letters on various familiar
articles. The child was taught by mere contiguity to pick
out a certain number of particular articles when made to
feel the letters. But this was merely a collection of particular
signs, out of the mass of which the general purpose
of <i>signification</i> had not yet been extracted by the child's
mind. Dr. Howe compares his situation at this moment to
that of one lowering a line to the bottom of the deep sea in
which Laura's soul lay, and waiting until she should spontaneously
take hold of it and be raised into the light. The
moment came, 'accompanied by a radiant flash of intelligence
and glow of joy'; she seemed suddenly to become
aware of the general purpose imbedded in the different details
of all these signs, and from that moment her education
went on with extreme rapidity.</p>

<p>Another of the great capacities in which man has been
said to differ fundamentally from the animal is that of possessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
self-consciousness or reflective knowledge of himself
as a thinker. But this capacity also flows from our
criterion, for (without going into the matter very deeply)
we may say that the brute never reflects on himself as a
thinker, because he has never clearly dissociated, in the
full concrete act of thought, the element of the thing
thought of and the operation by which he thinks it. They
remain always fused, conglomerated&mdash;just as the interjectional
vocal sign of the brute almost invariably merges in
his mind with the thing signified, and is not independently
attended to <i>in se</i>.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>Now, the dissociation of these two elements probably
occurs first in the child's mind on the occasion of some
error or false expectation which would make him experience
the shock of difference between merely imagining a thing
and getting it. The thought experienced once with the
concomitant reality, and then without it or with opposite
concomitants, reminds the child of other cases in which the
same provoking phenomenon occurred. Thus the general
ingredient of error may be dissociated and noticed <i>per se</i>,
and from the notion of his error or wrong thought to that of
his thought in general the transition is easy. The brute, no
doubt, has plenty of instances of error and disappointment
in his life, but the similar shock is in him most likely always
swallowed up in the accidents of the actual case. An
expectation disappointed may breed dubiety as to the realization
of that particular thing when the dog next expects
it. But that disappointment, that dubiety, while they are
present in the mind, will <i>not</i> call up other cases, in which
the material details were different, but this feature of possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
error was the same. The brute will, therefore, stop
short of dissociating the general notion of error <i>per se</i>, and
<i>a fortiori</i> will never attain the conception of Thought itself
as such.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We may then, we think, consider it proven that <i>the most
elementary single difference between the human mind and that of
brutes lies in this deficiency on the brute's part to associate ideas
by similarity</i>&mdash;characters, the abstraction of which depends
on this sort of association, must in the brute always remain
drowned, swamped in the total phenomenon which they
help constitute, and never used to reason from. If a character
stands out alone, it is always some obvious sensible
quality like a sound or a smell which is instinctively exciting
and lies in the line of the animal's propensities; or it
is some obvious sign which experience has habitually
coupled with a consequence, such as, for the dog, the sight
of his master's hat on and the master's going out.</p>


<h4>DIFFERENT ORDERS OF HUMAN GENIUS.</h4>


<p>But, now, since nature never makes a jump, it is evident
that we should find the lowest men occupying in this respect
an intermediate position between the brutes and the highest
men. And so we do. Beyond the analogies which their own
minds suggest by breaking up the literal sequence of their
experience, there is a whole world of analogies which they
can appreciate when imparted to them by their betters, but
which they could never excogitate alone. This answers
the question why Darwin and Newton had to be waited for
so long. The flash of similarity between an apple and the
moon, between the rivalry for food in nature and the rivalry
for man's selection, was too recondite to have occurred to any
but exceptional minds. <i>Genius, then,</i> as has been already
said, <i>is identical with the possession of similar association
to an extreme degree.</i> Professor Bain says: "This I count
the leading fact of genius. I consider it quite impossible
to afford any explanation of intellectual originality except
on the supposition of unusual energy on this point." Alike
in the arts, in literature, in practical affairs, and in science,
association by similarity is the prime condition of success.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>
<p>But as, according to our view, there are two stages in
reasoned thought, one where similarity merely <i>operates</i> to
call up cognate thoughts, and another farther stage, where
the bond of identity between the cognate thoughts is
<i>noticed</i>; so <i>minds of genius may be divided into two main
sorts, those who notice the bond and those who merely obey it.</i>
The first are the abstract reasoners, properly so called,
the men of science, and philosophers&mdash;the analysts, in
a word; the latter are the poets, the critics&mdash;the artists,
in a word, the men of intuitions. These judge rightly,
classify cases, characterize them by the most striking analogic
epithets, but go no further. At first sight it might
seem that the analytic mind represented simply a higher
intellectual stage, and that the intuitive mind represented
an arrested stage of intellectual development; but the difference
is not so simple as this. Professor Bain has said
that a man's advance to the scientific stage (the stage of
noticing and abstracting the bond of similarity) may often
be due to an <i>absence</i> of certain emotional sensibilities. The
sense of color, he says, may no less determine a mind away
from science than it determines it toward painting. There
must be a penury in one's interest in the details of particular
forms in order to permit the forces of the intellect to
be concentrated on what is common to many forms.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> In
other words, supposing a mind fertile in the suggestion of
analogies, but, at the same time, keenly interested in the
particulars of each suggested image, that mind would be
far less apt to single out the particular character which
called up the analogy than one whose interests were less
generally lively. A certain richness of the æsthetic nature
may, therefore, easily keep one in the intuitive stage. All
the poets are examples of this. Take Homer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ulysses, too, spied round the house to see if any man were still
alive and hiding, trying to get away from gloomy death. He found
them all fallen in the blood and dirt, and in such number as the fish
which the fishermen to the low shore, out of the foaming sea, drag
with their meshy nets. These all, sick for the ocean water, are strewn
around the sands, while the blazing sun takes their life from them. So
there the suitors lay strewn round on one another." Or again:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>
<p>"And as when a Mæonian or a Carian woman stains ivory with
purple to be a cheek-piece for horses, and it is kept in the chamber, and
many horsemen have prayed to bear it off; but it is kept a treasure for
a king, both a trapping for his horse and a glory to the driver&mdash;in such
wise were thy stout thighs, Menelaos, and legs and fair ankles stained
with blood."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A man in whom all the accidents of an analogy rise up
as vividly as this, may be excused for not attending to the
ground of the analogy. But he need not on that account
be deemed intellectually the inferior of a man of drier mind,
in whom the ground is not as liable to be eclipsed by the
general splendor. Barely are both sorts of intellect, the
splendid and the analytic, found in conjunction. Plato
among philosophers, and M. Taine, who cannot quote a
child's saying without describing the '<i>voix chantante,
étonnée, heureuse</i>' in which it is uttered, are only exceptions
whose strangeness proves the rule.</p>

<p>An often-quoted writer has said that Shakespeare possessed
more <i>intellectual power</i> than any one else that ever
lived. If by this he meant the power to pass from given
premises to right or congruous conclusions, it is no doubt
true. The abrupt transitions in Shakespeare's thought
astonish the reader by their unexpectedness no less than
they delight him by their fitness. Why, for instance, does
the death of Othello so stir the spectator's blood and leave
him with a sense of reconcilement? Shakespeare himself
could very likely not say why; for his invention, though
rational, was not ratiocinative. Wishing the curtain to fall
upon a reinstated Othello, that speech about the turbaned
Turk suddenly simply flashed across him as the right end of
all that went before. The dry critic who comes after can,
however, point out the subtle bonds of identity that guided
Shakespeare's pen through that speech to the death of the
Moor. Othello is sunk in ignominy, lapsed from his
height at the beginning of the play. What better way
to rescue him at last from this abasement than to make
him for an instant identify himself in memory with the old
Othello of better days, and then execute justice on his present
disowned body, as he used then to smite all enemies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
the State? But Shakespeare, whose mind supplied these
means, could probably not have told why they were so
effective.</p>

<p>But though this is true, and though it would be absurd
in an absolute way to say that a given analytic mind was
superior to any intuitional one, yet it is none the less true
that the former <i>represents</i> the higher stage. Men, taken
historically, reason by analogy long before they have learned
to reason by abstract characters. Association by similarity
and true reasoning may have identical results. If a philosopher
wishes to prove to you why you should do a certain
thing, he may do so by using abstract considerations exclusively;
a savage will prove the same by reminding you of a
similar case in which you notoriously do as he now proposes,
and this with no ability to state the <i>point</i> in which
the cases are similar. In all primitive literature, in all
savage oratory, we find persuasion carried on exclusively
by parables and similes, and travellers in savage countries
readily adopt the native custom. Take, for example, Dr.
Livingstone's argument with the negro conjuror. The missionary
was trying to dissuade the savage from his fetichistic
ways of invoking rain. "You see," said he, "that, after all
your operations, sometimes it rains and sometimes it does
not, exactly as when you have not operated at all." "But,"
replied the sorcerer, "it is just the same with you doctors;
you give your remedies, and sometimes the patient gets well
and sometimes he dies, just as when you do nothing at all."
To that the pious missionary replied: "The doctor does his
duty, after which God performs the cure if it pleases Him."
"Well," rejoined the savage, "it is just so with me. I do
what is necessary to procure rain, after which God sends it
or withholds it according to His pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>This is the stage in which proverbial philosophy reigns
supreme. "An empty sack can't stand straight" will stand
for the reason why a man with debts may lose his honesty;
and "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" will serve
to back up one's exhortations to prudence. Or we answer
the question: "Why is snow white?" by saying, "For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
same reason that soap-suds or whipped eggs are white"&mdash;in
other words, instead of giving the <i>reason</i> for a fact, we
give another <i>example</i> of the same fact. This offering a similar
instance, instead of a reason, has often been criticised
as one of the forms of logical depravity in men. But manifestly
it is not a perverse act of thought, but only an incomplete
one. Furnishing parallel cases is the necessary
first step towards abstracting the reason imbedded in
them all.</p>

<p>As it is with reasons, so it is with words. The first
words are probably always names of entire things and entire
actions, of extensive coherent groups. A new experience
in the primitive man can only be talked about by
him in terms of the old experiences which have received
names. It reminds him of certain ones from among them,
but the <i>points</i> in which it agrees with them are neither
named nor dissociated. Pure similarity must work before
the abstraction can work which is based upon it. The first
adjectives will therefore probably be total nouns embodying
the striking character. The primeval man will say,
not 'the bread is hard,' but 'the bread is stone'; not
'the face is round,' but 'the face is moon'; not 'the
fruit is sweet,' but 'the fruit is sugar-cane.' The first
words are thus neither particular nor general, but <i>vaguely</i>
concrete; just as we speak of an 'oval' face, a 'velvet'
skin, or an 'iron' will, without meaning to connote any
other attributes of the adjective-noun than those in which
it <i>does</i> resemble the noun it is used to qualify. After
a while certain of these adjectively-used nouns come only
to signify the particular quality for whose sake they are
oftenest used; the <i>entire thing</i> which they originally meant
receives another name, and they become true abstract
and general terms. Oval, for example, with us suggests
<i>only</i> shape. The first abstract qualities thus formed are,
no doubt, qualities of one and the same sense found in
different objects&mdash;as big, sweet; next analogies between
different senses, as 'sharp' of taste, 'high' of sound, etc.;
then analogies of motor combinations, or form of relation,
as simple, confused, difficult, reciprocal, relative, spontaneous,
etc. The extreme degree of subtlety in analogy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
reached in such cases as when we say certain English art
critics' writing reminds us of a close room in which pastilles
have been burning, or that the mind of certain Frenchmen
is like old Roquefort cheese. Here language utterly fails
to hit upon the basis of resemblance.</p>

<p>Over immense departments of our thought we are still,
all of us, in the savage state. Similarity operates in us, but
abstraction has not taken place. We know what the present
case is like, we know what it reminds us of, we have an
intuition of the right course to take, if it be a practical matter.
But analytic thought has made no tracks, and we cannot
justify ourselves to others. In ethical, psychological,
and æsthetic matters, to give a clear reason for one's judgment
is universally recognized as a mark of rare genius.
The helplessness of uneducated people to account for their
likes and dislikes is often ludicrous. Ask the first Irish
girl why she likes this country better or worse than her
home, and see how much she can tell you. But if you ask
your most educated friend why he prefers Titian to Paul
Veronese, you will hardly get more of a reply; and you will
probably get absolutely none if you inquire why Beethoven
reminds him of Michael Angelo, or how it comes that a
bare figure with unduly flexed joints, by the latter, can so
suggest the moral tragedy of life. His thought obeys a
<i>nexus</i>, but cannot name it. And so it is with all those judgments
of <i>experts</i>, which even though unmotived are so valuable.
Saturated with experience of a particular class of
materials, an expert intuitively feels whether a newly-reported
fact is probable or not, whether a proposed hypothesis
is worthless or the reverse. He instinctively knows
that, in a novel case, this and not that will be the promising
course of action. The well-known story of the old judge
advising the new one never to give reasons for his decisions,
"the decisions will probably be right, the reasons will surely
be wrong," illustrates this. The doctor will feel that the
patient is doomed, the dentist will have a premonition that
the tooth will break, though neither can articulate a reason
for his foreboding. The reason lies imbedded, but not yet
laid bare, in all the countless previous cases dimly suggested
by the actual one, all calling up the same conclusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
which the adept thus finds himself swept on to, he knows
not how or why.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>A physiological conclusion remains to be drawn.</i> If the
principles laid down in Chapter XIV are true, then it follows
that the great cerebral difference between habitual and
reasoned thinking must be this: that in the former an entire
system of cells vibrating at any one moment discharges in
its totality into another entire system, and that the order
of the discharges tends to be a constant one in time; whilst
in the latter a part of the prior system still keeps vibrating
in the midst of the subsequent system, and the order&mdash;which
part this shall be, and what shall be its concomitants
in the subsequent system&mdash;has little tendency to fixedness
in time. This physical selection, so to call it, of one part
to vibrate persistently whilst the others rise and subside,
we found, in the chapter in question, to be the basis of
similar association. (See especially Vol. I. pp. 578-81.) It would
seem to be but a minor degree of that still more urgent
and importunate localized vibration which we can easiest
conceive to underlie the mental fact of interest, attention,
or dissociation. In terms of the brain-process, then, all
these mental facts resolve themselves into a single peculiarity:
that of indeterminateness of connection between
the different tracts, and tendency of action to focalize
itself, so to speak, in small localities which vary infinitely
at different times, and from which irradiation may proceed
in countless shifting ways. (Compare figure 80, <a href="#Page_347">p.
347</a>.) To discover, or (what more befits the present stage
of nerve-physiology) to adumbrate by some possible guess,
on what chemical or molecular-mechanical fact this instable
equilibrium of the human brain may depend, should be the
next task of the physiologist who ponders over the passage
from brute to man. Whatever the physical peculiarity in
question may be, <i>it</i> is the cause why a man, whose brain
has it, reasons so much, whilst his horse, whose brain lacks
it, reasons so little. We can but bequeath the problem to
abler hands than our own.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, this mode of stating the matter suggests
a couple of other inferences. The first is brief. If <i>focalization</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
of brain-activity be the fundamental fact of reasonable
thought, we see why intense interest or concentrated passion
makes us think so much more truly and profoundly.
The persistent <i>focalization</i> of motion in certain tracts is the
cerebral fact corresponding to the persistent domination in
consciousness of the important feature of the subject.
When not 'focalized,' we are scatter-brained; but when
thoroughly impassioned, we never wander from the point.
None but congruous and relevant images arise. When
roused by indignation or moral enthusiasm, how trenchant
are our reflections, how smiting are our words! The whole
network of petty scruples and by-considerations which, at
ordinary languid times, surrounded the matter like a cobweb,
holding back our thought, as Gulliver was pinned to
the earth by the myriad Lilliputian threads, are dashed
through at a blow, and the subject stands with its essential
and vital lines revealed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The last point is relative to the theory that what was
acquired habit in the ancestor may become congenital tendency
in the offspring. So vast a superstructure is raised
upon this principle that the paucity of empirical evidence
for it has alike been matter of regret to its adherents, and
of triumph to its opponents. In <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVIII">Chapter XXVIII</a> we shall
see what we may call the whole beggarly array of proof.
In the human race, where our opportunities for observation
are the most complete, we seem to have no evidence whatever
which would support the hypothesis, unless it possibly
be the law that city-bred children are more apt to be
near-sighted than country children. In the mental world
we certainly do not observe that the children of great
travellers get their geography lessons with unusual ease,
or that a baby whose ancestors have spoken German for
thirty generations will, on that account, learn Italian any
the less easily from its Italian nurse. But if the considerations
we have been led to are true, they explain
perfectly well why this law <i>should not</i> be verified in the
human race, and why, therefore, in looking for evidence
on the subject, we should confine ourselves exclusively to
lower animals. In them fixed habit is the essential and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
characteristic law of nervous action. The brain grows to
the exact modes in which it has been exercised, and the inheritance
of these modes&mdash;then called instincts&mdash;would
have in it nothing surprising. But in man the negation of
all fixed modes is the essential characteristic. He owes his
whole pre-eminence as a reasoner, his whole human quality
of intellect, we may say, to the facility with which a given
mode of thought in him may suddenly be broken up into
elements, which recombine anew. Only at the price of inheriting
no settled instinctive tendencies is he able to settle
every novel case by the fresh discovery by his reason of
novel principles. He is, <i>par excellence</i>, the <i>educable</i> animal.
If, then, the law that habits are inherited were found exemplified
in him, he would, in so far forth, fall short of his
human perfections; and, when we survey the human races,
we actually do find that those which are most instinctive at
the outset are those which, on the whole, are least educated
in the end. An untutored Italian is, to a great extent, a
man of the world; he has instinctive perceptions, tendencies
to behavior, reactions, in a word, upon his environment,
which the untutored German wholly lacks. If the latter be
not drilled, he is apt to be a thoroughly loutish personage;
but, on the other hand, the mere absence in his brain of
definite innate tendencies enables him to advance by the development,
through education, of his purely reasoned thinking,
into complex regions of consciousness that the Italian
may probably never approach.</p>

<p>We observe an identical difference between men as a
whole and women as a whole. A young woman of twenty reacts
with intuitive promptitude and security in all the usual
circumstances in which she may be placed.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Her likes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
and dislikes are formed; her opinions, to a great extent, the
same that they will be through life. Her character is, in
fact, finished in its essentials. How inferior to her is a boy
of twenty in all these respects! His character is still gelatinous,
uncertain what shape to assume, 'trying it on' in
every direction. Feeling his power, yet ignorant of the
manner in which he shall express it, he is, when compared
with his sister, a being of no definite contour. But this
absence of prompt tendency in his brain to set into particular
modes is the very condition which insures that it shall
ultimately become so much more efficient than the woman's.
The very lack of preappointed trains of thought is the
ground on which general principles and heads of classification
grow up; and the masculine brain deals with new
and complex matter indirectly by means of these, in a
manner which the feminine method of direct intuition, admirably
and rapidly as it performs within its limits, can
vainly hope to cope with.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In looking back over the subject of reasoning, one feels
how intimately connected it is with conception; and one
realizes more than ever the deep reach of that principle of
selection on which so much stress was laid towards the close
of Chapter IX. As the art of reading (after a certain stage
in one's education) is the art of skipping, so the art of being
wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. The first effect
on the mind of growing cultivated is that processes once
multiple get to be performed by a single act. Lazarus has
called this the progressive 'condensation' of thought.
But in the psychological sense it is less a condensation than
a loss, a genuine dropping out and throwing overboard of
conscious content. Steps really sink from sight. An advanced
thinker sees the relations of his topics in such
masses and so instantaneously that when he comes to
explain to younger minds it is often hard to say which
grows the more perplexed, he or the pupil. In every university
there are admirable investigators who are notoriously
bad lecturers. The reason is that they never spontaneously
see the subject in the minute articulate way in
which the student needs to have it offered to his slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
reception. They grope for the links, but the links do not
come. Bowditch, who translated and annotated Laplace's
Mécanique Céleste, said that whenever his author prefaced
a proposition by the words 'it is evident,' he knew that
many hours of hard study lay before him.</p>

<p>When two minds of a high order, interested in kindred
subjects, come together, their conversation is chiefly remarkable
for the summariness of its allusions and the
rapidity of its transitions. Before one of them is half
through a sentence the other knows his meaning and
replies. Such genial play with such massive materials,
such an easy flashing of light over far perspectives, such
careless indifference to the dust and apparatus that ordinarily
surround the subject and seem to pertain to its
essence, make these conversations seem true feasts for
gods to a listener who is educated enough to follow them
at all. His mental lungs breathe more deeply, in an atmosphere
more broad and vast than is their wont. On the
other hand, the excessive explicitness and short-windedness
of an ordinary man are as wonderful as they are tedious to
the man of genius. But we need not go as far as the ways
of genius. Ordinary social intercourse will do. There the
charm of conversation is in direct proportion to the possibility
of abridgment and elision, and in inverse ratio to the
need of explicit statement. With old friends a word stands
for a whole story or set of opinions. With new-comers
everything must be gone over in detail. Some persons
have a real mania for completeness, they must express
every step. They are the most intolerable of companions,
and although their mental energy may in its way be great,
they always strike us as weak and second-rate. In short,
the essence of plebeianism, that which separates vulgarity
from aristocracy, is perhaps less a defect than an excess,
the constant need to animadvert upon matters which for
the aristocratic temperament do not exist. To ignore, to
disdain to consider, to overlook, are the essence of the
'gentleman.' Often most provokingly so; for the things
ignored may be of the deepest moral consequence. But in
the very midst of our indignation with the gentleman, we
have a consciousness that his preposterous inertia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
negativeness in the actual emergency is, somehow or other,
<i>allied</i> with his general superiority to ourselves. It is not
only that the gentleman ignores considerations relative to
conduct, sordid suspicions, fears, calculations, etc., which
the vulgarian is fated to entertain; it is that he is silent
where the vulgarian talks; that he gives nothing but results
where the vulgarian is profuse of reasons; that he does not
explain or apologize; that he uses one sentence instead of
twenty; and that, in a word, there is an amount of <i>interstitial</i>
thinking, so to call it, which it is quite impossible to
get him to perform, but which is nearly all that the vulgarian
mind performs at all. All this suppression of the
secondary leaves the field <i>clear</i>,&mdash;for higher flights, should
they choose to come. But even if they never came, what
thoughts there were would still manifest the aristocratic
type and wear the well-bred form. So great is our sense
of harmony and ease in passing from the company of a philistine
to that of an aristocratic temperament, that we are
almost tempted to deem the falsest views and tastes as held
by a man of the world, truer than the truest as held by a
common person. In the latter the best ideas are choked,
obstructed, and contaminated by the redundancy of their
paltry associates. The negative conditions, at least, of an
atmosphere and a free outlook are present in the former.</p>

<p>I may appear to have strayed from psychological analysis
into æsthetic criticism. But the principle of selection
is so important that no illustrations seem redundant
which may help to show how great is its scope. The
upshot of what I say simply is that selection implies rejection
as well as choice; and that the function of ignoring, of
<i>in</i>attention, is as vital a factor in mental progress as the
function of attention itself.</p>

which is so much in the spirit of the text that I cannot forbear to quote it.
"The observer is not he who merely sees the thing which is before his
eyes, but he who sees what parts that thing is composed of. To do this
well is a rare talent. One person, from inattention, or attending only in
the wrong place, overlooks half of what he sees; another sets down much
more than he sees, confounding it with what he imagines, or with what
he infers; another takes note of the <i>kind</i> of all the circumstances, but
being inexpert in estimating their degree, leaves the quantity of each
vague and uncertain; another sees indeed the whole, but makes such
an awkward division of it into parts, throwing things into one mass
which require to be separated, and separating others which might more
conveniently be considered as one, that the result is much the same,
sometimes even worse, than if no analysis had been attempted at all. It
would be possible to point out what qualities of mind, and modes of
mental culture, fit a person for being a good observer: that, however, is
a question not of Logic, but of the Theory of Education, in the most enlarged
sense of the term. There is not properly an Art of Observing.
There may be rules for observing. But these, like rules for inventing, are
properly instructions for the preparation of one's own mind; for putting
it into the state in which it will be most fitted to observe, or most likely to
invent. They are, therefore, essentially rules of self-education, which is
a different thing from Logic. They do not teach how to do the thing,
but how to make ourselves capable of doing it. They are an art of
strengthening the limbs, not an art of using them. The extent and minuteness
of observation which may be requisite, and the degree of decomposition
to which it may be necessary to carry the mental analysis, depend on
the particular purpose in view. To ascertain the state of the whole universe
at any particular moment is impossible, but would also be useless.
In making chemical experiments, we do not think it necessary to note the
position of the planets; because experience has shown, as a very superficial
experience is sufficient to show, that in such cases that circumstance is not
material to the result: and accordingly, in the ages when man believed in
the occult influences of the heavenly bodies, it might have been unphilosophical
to omit ascertaining the precise condition of those bodies at the
moment of the experiment." (Logic, bk. iii. chap. vii. § 1. Cf. also bk.
iv. chap. ii.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_329_329" id="Footnote_329_329"></a><a href="#FNanchor_329_329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a> I may quote a passage from an article entitled 'The Sentiment of
Rationality,' published in vol. iv of Mind, 1879: "What is a <i>conception</i>?
It is a <i>teleological instrument</i>. It is a partial aspect of a thing which
<i>for our purpose</i> we regard as its essential aspect, as the representative
of the entire thing. In comparison with this aspect, whatever other
properties and qualities the thing may have are unimportant accidents
which we may without blame ignore. But the essence, the ground
of conception, varies with the end we have in view. A substance like
oil has as many different essences as it has uses to different individuals.
One man conceives it as a combustible, another as a lubricator, another as
a food; the chemist thinks of it as a hydrocarbon; the furniture-maker
as a darkener of wood; the speculator as a commodity whose market-price
to-day is this and to-morrow that. The soap-boiler, the physicist, the
clothes-scourer severally ascribe to it other essences in relation to their
needs. Ueberweg's doctrine that the essential quality of a thing is the
quality of most <i>worth</i> is strictly true; but Ueberweg has failed to note
that the worth is wholly relative to the temporary interests of the conceiver.
And, even, when his interest is distinctly defined in his own mind, the
discrimination of the quality in the object which has the closest connection
with it is a thing which no rules can teach. The only <i>a priori</i> advice that
can be given to a man embarking on life with a certain purpose is the
somewhat barren counsel: Be sure that in the circumstances that meet
you, you attend to the <i>right</i> ones for your purpose. To pick out the right
ones is the measure of the man. 'Millions,' says Hartmann, 'stare at the
phenomenon before a <i>genialer Kopf</i> pounces on the concept.' The genius
is simply he to whom, when he opens his eyes upon the world, the 'right'
characters are the prominent ones. The fool is he who, with the same
purposes as the genius, infallibly gets his attention tangled amid the
accidents."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_330_330" id="Footnote_330_330"></a><a href="#FNanchor_330_330"><span class="label">[330]</span></a> Only if one of our purposes were itself truer than another, could one
of our conceptions become the truer conception. To be a truer purpose,
however, our purpose must conform more to some absolute standard of
purpose in things to which our purposes ought to conform. This shows
that the whole doctrine of essential characters is intimately bound up
with a teleological view of the world. Materialism becomes self-contradictory
when it denies teleology, and yet in the same breath calls atoms, etc.,
the <i>essential</i> facts. The world contains consciousness as well as atoms&mdash;and
the one must be written down as just as essential as the other, in the absence
of any declared purpose regarding them on the creator's part, or in
the absence of any creator. As far as we ourselves go, the atoms are worth
more for purposes of deduction, the consciousness for purposes of inspiration.
We may fairly write the Universe in either way, thus: <span class="smcap">Atoms</span>-producing-consciousness;
or <span class="smcap">Consciousness</span>-produced-by-atoms. Atoms
alone, or consciousness alone, are precisely equal mutilations of the truth.
If, without believing in a God, I still continue to talk of what the world
'essentially is,' I am just as much entitled to define it as a place in which
my nose itches, or as a place where at a certain corner I can get a mess
of oysters for twenty cents, as to call it an evolving nebula differentiating
and integrating itself. It is hard to say which of the three abstractions is
the more rotten or miserable substitute for the world's concrete fulness.
To conceive it merely as 'God's work' would be a similar mutilation of
it, so long as we said not what God, or what kind of work. The only real
truth about the world, apart from particular purposes, is the <i>total</i> truth.</p></div>

reasoning and the only conclusion he cares to reach is the bare naming of
the datum. "What is that?" is our first question relative to any unknown
thing. And the ease with which our curiosity is quenched as soon as we
are supplied with any sort of a name to call the object by, is ridiculous
enough. To quote from an unpublished essay by a former student of
mine, Mr. R. W. Black: "The simplest end which a thing's predicate can
serve is the satisfaction of the desire for unity itself, the mere desire that
the thing shall be the same with <i>something</i> else. Why, the other day,
when I mistook a portrait of Shakespeare for one of Hawthorne, was I not,
on psychological principles, as right as if I had correctly named it?&mdash;the
two pictures had a common essence, bald forehead, mustache, flowing
hair. Simply because the only end that could possibly be served by naming
it Hawthorne was my desire to have it so. With reference to any other end
that classification of it would not serve. And every unity, every identity,
every classification is rightly called fanciful unless it serves some other end
than the mere satisfaction, emotion, or inspiration caught by momentarily
believing in it."</p></div>

being valuable in any such abstract way as <i>we</i> have these notions is
more than doubtful. The conduct is more likely an impulsive result of a
conspiracy of outward stimuli; the beast <i>feels like</i> acting so when these
stimuli are present, though conscious of no definite reason why. The
distinction of recept and concept is useful here. Some breeds of dogs,
e.g. collies, seem instinctively to defend their master's property. The case
is similar to that of a dog's barking at people after dark, at whom he would
not bark in daylight. I have heard this quoted as evidence of the dog's
reasoning power. It is only, as Chapter III has shown us, the impulsive
result of a summation of stimuli, and has no connection with reasoning.

In certain stages of the hypnotic trance the subject seems to lapse into
the non-analytic state. If a sheet of ruled foolscap paper, or a paper with
a fine monotonous ornamental pattern printed on it, be shown to the subject,
and <i>one</i> of the ruled lines or elements of the pattern be pointed to for
an instant, and the paper immediately removed, he will then almost always,
when after a short interval the paper is presented to him again, pick out the
indicated line or element with infallible correctness. The operator, meanwhile,
has either to keep his eye fixed upon it, or to make sure of its position
by counting, in order not to lose its place. Just so we may remember
a friend's house in a street by the single character of its number rather
than by its general look. The trance-subject would seem, in these instances,
to surrender himself to the general look. He disperses his attention
impartially over the sheet. The place of the particular line touched is part
of a 'total effect' which he gets in its entirety, and which would be distorted
if another line were touched instead. This total effect is lost upon the
normal looker-on, bent as he is on concentration, analysis, and emphasis.
What wonder, then, that, under these experimental conditions, the trance-subject
excels him in touching the right line again? If he has time given
him to count the line, he will excel the trance-subject; but if the time be too
short to count, he will best succeed by following the trance-method, abstaining
from analysis, and being guided by the 'general look' of the line's
place on the sheet. One is surprised at one's success in this the moment one
gives up one's habitually analytic state of mind.
</p>
<p>
Is it too much to say that we have in this dispersion of the attention
and subjection to the 'general effect' something like a relapse into the
state of mind of brutes? The trance-subject never gives any other reason
for his optical discriminations, save that 'it looks so.' So a man, on a road
once traversed inattentively before, takes a certain turn for no reason except
that <i>he feels</i> as if it must be right. He is guided by a sum of impressions,
not one of which is emphatic or distinguished from the rest, not one
of which is essential, not one of which is <i>conceived</i>, but all of which
together drive him to a conclusion to which nothing but <i>that</i> sum-total
leads. Are not some of the wonderful discriminations of animals explicable
in the same way? The cow finds her own stanchions in the long
stable, the horse stops at the house he has once stopped at in the monotonous
street, because no other stanchions, no other house, yield impartially <i>all</i>
the impressions of the previous experience. The man, however, by seeking
to make some one impression characteristic and essential, prevents the
rest from having their effect. So that, if the (for him) essential feature be
forgotten or changed, he is too apt to be thrown off altogether, and then
the brute or the trance-subject may seem to outstrip him in sagacity.

Dr. Romanes's already quoted distinction between 'receptual' and
'conceptual' thought (published since the body of my text and my note
were written) connotes conveniently the difference which I seek to point
out. See also his Mental Evolution in Man, p. 197 ff., for proofs of the
fact that in a receptual way brutes cognize the mental states of other brutes
and men.</p></div>

is mistaking the wrong part of the phenomenon for the whole, whilst
reasoning is, according to our definition, based on the substitution of the
right part for the whole, it might be said that confusion and reasoning
are generically the same process. I believe that they are so, and that the
only difference between a muddle-head and a genius is that between extracting
wrong characters and right ones. In other words, a muddle-headed
person is a genius spoiled in the making. I think it will be admitted
that all <i>eminently</i> muddle-headed persons have the temperament of genius.
They are constantly breaking away from the usual consecutions of concretes.
A common associator by contiguity is too closely tied to routine to

open latches, locks, etc. Their feats are usually ascribed to their reasoning
powers. But Dr. Romanes well remarks (Mental Evolution, etc., p.
351, note) that we ought first to be sure that the actions are not due to mere
association. A cat is constantly playing with things with her paws; a trick
accidentally hit upon may be retained. Romanes notes the fact that the
animals most skilled in this way need not be the most generally intelligent,
but those which have the best corporeal members for handling things,
cat's paws, horse's lips, elephant's trunk, cow's horns. The monkey has
both the corporeal and the intellectual superiority. And my deprecatory

<p><a name="Footnote_339_339" id="Footnote_339_339"></a><a href="#FNanchor_339_339"><span class="label">[339]</span></a> There are two other conditions of language in the human being, additional
to association by similarity, that assist its action, or rather pave the
way for it. These are: first, the great natural loquacity; and, second, the
great imitativeness of man. The first produces the original reflex interjectional
sign; the second (as Bleek has well shown) fixes it, stamps it, and
ends by multiplying the number of determinate specific signs which are a
requisite preliminary to the general conscious purpose of sign-making,
which I have called the characteristic human element in language. The
way in which imitativeness fixes the meaning of signs is this: When a primeval
man has a given emotion, he utters his natural interjection; or when
(to avoid supposing that the reflex sounds are exceedingly determinate by
nature) a group of such men experience a common emotion, and one takes
the lead in the cry, the others cry like him from sympathy or imitativeness.
Now, let one of the group hear another, who is in presence of the
experience, utter the cry; he, even without the experience, will repeat the
cry from pure imitativeness. But, as he repeats the sign, he will be reminded
by it of his own former experience. Thus, first, he has the sign
with the emotion; then, without it; then, with it again. It is "dissociated
by change of concomitants"; he feels it as a separate entity and yet as having
a connection with the emotion. Immediately it becomes possible for
him to couple it deliberately with the emotion, in cases where the latter
would either have provoked no interjectional cry or not the same one. In
a word, his mental procedure tends to <i>fix</i> this cry on <i>that</i> emotion; and
when this occurs, in many instances, he is provided with a stock of signs,
like the yelp, beg, rat of the dog, each of which suggests a determinate
image. On this stock, then, similarity works in the way above explained.</p></div>

<h4>THE PRODUCTION OF MOVEMENT.</h4>


<p>The reader will not have forgotten, in the jungle of
purely inward processes and products through which the
last chapters have borne him, that the final result of them
all must be some form of bodily activity due to the escape
of the central excitement through outgoing nerves. The
whole neural organism, it will be remembered, is, physiologically
considered, but a machine for converting stimuli
into reactions; and the intellectual part of our life is knit
up with but the middle or 'central' portion of the machine's
operations. Let us now turn to consider the final or emergent
operations, the bodily activities, and the forms of consciousness
connected therewithal.</p>

<p>Every impression which impinges on the incoming
nerves produces some discharge down the outgoing ones,
whether we be aware of it or not. Using sweeping terms
and ignoring exceptions, <i>we might say that every possible feeling
produces a movement, and that the movement is a movement
of the entire organism, and of each and all its parts.</i> What
happens patently when an explosion or a flash of lightning
startles us, or when we are tickled, happens latently with
every sensation which we receive. The only reason why we
do not feel the startle or tickle in the case of insignificant
sensations is partly its very small amount, partly our obtuseness.
Professor Bain many years ago gave the name of the
Law of Diffusion to this phenomenon of general discharge,
and expressed it thus: "According as an impression is accompanied
with Feeling, the aroused currents diffuse themselves
over the brain, leading to a general agitation of the
moving organs, as well as affecting the viscera."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>
<p>In cases where the feeling is strong the law is too familiar
to require proof. As Prof. Bain says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Each of us knows in our own experience that a sudden shock of
feeling is accompanied with movements of the body generally, and with
other effects. When no emotion is present, we are quiescent; a slight
feeling is accompanied with slight manifestations; a more intense shock
has a more intense outburst. Every pleasure and every pain, and every
mode of emotion, has a definite wave of effects, which our observation
makes known to us; and we apply the knowledge to infer other men's
feelings from their outward display.... The organs first and prominently
affected, in the diffused wave of nervous influence, are the moving
members, and of these, by preference, the features of the face (with
the ears in animals), whose movements constitute the <i>expression</i> of the
countenance. But the influence extends to all the parts of the moving
system, voluntary and involuntary; while an important series of effects
are produced on the glands and viscera&mdash;the stomach, lungs, heart, kidneys,
skin, together with the sexual and mammary organs.... The
circumstance is seemingly universal, the proof of it does not require a
citation of instances in detail; on the objectors is thrown the burden of
adducing unequivocal exceptions to the law."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There are probably no exceptions to the diffusion of
every impression through the <i>nerve-centres</i>. The <i>effect</i> of
the wave through the centres may, however, often be to
interfere with processes, and to diminish tensions already
existing there; and the outward consequences of such
inhibitions may be the arrest of discharges from the
inhibited regions and the checking of bodily activities
already in process of occurrence. When this happens it
probably is like the draining or siphoning of certain channels
by currents flowing through others. When, in walking,
we suddenly stand still because a sound, sight, smell, or
thought catches our attention, something like this occurs.
But there are cases of arrest of peripheral activity which
depend, not on central inhibition, but on stimulation of
centres which discharge outgoing currents of an inhibitory
sort. Whenever we are startled, for example, our heart
momentarily stops or slows its beating, and then palpitates
with accelerated speed. The brief arrest is due to an outgoing
current down the pneumogastric nerve. This nerve,
when stimulated, stops or slows the heart-beats, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
particular effect of startling fails to occur if the nerve
be cut.</p>

<p>In general, however, the stimulating effects of a sense-impression
preponderate over the inhibiting effects, so that
we may roughly say, as we began by saying, that the wave
of discharge produces an activity in all parts of the body.
The task of tracing out <i>all</i> the effects of any one incoming
sensation has not yet been performed by physiologists.
Recent years have, however, begun to enlarge our information;
and although I must refer to special treatises for the
full details, I can briefly string together here a number of
separate observations which prove the truth of the law of
diffusion.</p>

<p>First take <i>effects upon the circulation</i>. Those upon the
heart we have just seen. Haller long ago recorded that
the blood from an open vein flowed out faster at the beat of
a drum.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> In Chapter III. (Vol. I. p. 98) we learned how instantaneously,
according to Mosso, the circulation in the brain
is altered by changes of sensation and of the course of
thought. The effect of objects of fear, shame, and anger
upon the blood-supply of the skin, especially the skin of
the face, are too well known to need remark. Sensations of
the higher senses produce, according to Couty and Charpentier,
the most varied effects upon the pulse-rate and
blood-pressure in dogs. Fig. 81, a pulse-tracing from these
authors, shows the tumultuous effect on a dog's heart of
hearing the screams of another dog. The changes of
blood-pressure still occurred when the pneumogastric
nerves were cut, showing the vaso-motor effect to be direct
and not dependent on the heart. When Mosso invented
that simple instrument, the <i>plethysmograph</i>, for recording
the fluctuations in volume of the members of the body, what
most astonished him, he says, "in the first experiments
which he made in Italy, was the extreme unrest of the
blood-vessels of the hand, which at every smallest emotion,
whether during waking or during sleep, changed their volume
in surprising fashion."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Figure 82 (from Féré<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a><br /><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>

<p><i>The effects upon respiration</i> of sudden sensory stimuli
are also too well known to need elaborate comment. We
'catch our breath' at every sudden sound. We 'hold our
breath' whenever our attention and expectation are strongly
engaged, and we sigh when the tension of the situation is
relieved. When a fearful object is before us we pant and
cannot deeply inspire; when the object makes us angry it
is, on the contrary, the act of expiration which is hard.

<p><i>On the sweat-glands,</i> similar consequences of sensorial
stimuli are observed. Tarchanoff, testing the condition of
the sweat-glands by the power of the skin to start a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
galvanic current through electrodes applied to its surface,
found that "nearly every kind of nervous activity, from the
simplest sensations and impressions, to voluntary motions
and the highest forms of mental exertion, is accompanied
by an increased activity in the glands of the skin."<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> <i>On
the pupil</i> observations are recorded by Sanders which show
that a transitory dilatation follows every sensorial stimulus
applied <i>during sleep</i>, even if the stimulus be not strong
enough to wake the subject up. At the moment of awaking
there is a dilatation, even if strong light falls on the
eye.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The pupil of children can easily be observed to
dilate enormously under the influence of <i>fear</i>. It is said to
dilate in pain and fatigue; and to contract, on the contrary,
in rage.</p>

<p>As regards <i>effects on the abdominal viscera</i>, they unquestionably
exist, but very few accurate observations have
been made.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>The bladder, bowels, and uterus respond to sensations,
even indifferent ones. Mosso and Pellicani, in their plethysmographic
investigations on the bladder of dogs, found
all sorts of sensorial stimuli to produce reflex contractions
of this organ, independent of those of the abdominal walls.
They call the bladder 'as good an æsthesiometer as the
iris,' and refer to the not uncommon reflex effects of psychic
stimuli in the human female upon this organ.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> M.
Féré has registered the contractions of the sphincter ani
which even indifferent sensations will produce. In some
pregnant women the fœtus is felt to move after almost
every sensorial excitement received by the mother. The
only natural explanation is that it is stimulated at such
moments by reflex contractions of the womb.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> That the
glands are affected in emotion is patent enough in the case
of the tears of grief, the dry mouth, moist skin, or diarrhœa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
of fear, the biliary disturbances which sometimes
follow upon rage, etc. The watering of the mouth at the
sight of succulent food is well known. It is difficult to
follow the smaller degrees of all these reflex changes, but
it can hardly be doubted that they exist in some degree,
even where they cease to be traceable, and that all our
sensations have some visceral effects. The sneezing produced
by sunshine, the roughening of the skin (goose-flesh)
which certain strokings, contacts, and sounds, musical or
non-musical, provoke, are facts of the same order as the
shuddering and standing up of the hair in fear, only of less
degree.</p>

<p><i>Effects on Voluntary Muscles.</i> Every sensorial stimulus
not only sends a special discharge into certain particular
muscles dependent on the special nature of the stimulus in
question&mdash;some of these special discharges we have studied
in Chapter XI, others we shall examine under the heads
of Instinct and Emotion&mdash;but it innervates the muscles
generally. M. Féré has given very curious experimental
proofs of this. The strength of contraction of the subject's
hand was measured by a self-registering dynamometer.
Ordinarily the maximum strength, under simple experimental
conditions, remains the same from day to day. But if
simultaneously with the contraction the subject received a
sensorial impression, the contraction was sometimes weakened,
but more often increased. This reinforcing effect has
received the name of <i>dynamogeny</i>. The dynamogenic value of
simple <i>musical notes</i> seems to be proportional to their loudness
and height. Where the notes are compounded into sad
strains, the muscular strength diminishes. If the strains are
gay, it is increased.&mdash;The dynamogenic value of <i>colored lights</i>
varies with the color. In a subject<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> whose normal strength
was expressed by 23, it became 24 when a blue light was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
thrown on the eyes, 28 for green, 30 for yellow, 35 for orange,
and 42 for red. Red is thus the most exciting color.
Among <i>tastes</i>, sweet has the lowest value, next comes salt,
then bitter, and finally sour, though, as M. Féré remarks,
such a sour as acetic acid excites the nerves of pain and
smell as well as of taste. The stimulating effects of tobacco-smoke,
alcohol, beef-extract (which is innutritious), etc., etc.,
may be partly due to a dynamogenic action of this sort.&mdash;Of
<i>odors</i>, that of musk seems to have a peculiar dynamogenic
power. Fig. 85 is a copy of one of M. Féré's dynamographic
tracings, which explains itself. The smaller
contractions are those without stimulus; the stronger ones
are due to the influence of red rays of light.</p>

<p>Everyone is familiar with the <i>patellar reflex</i>, or jerk upwards
of the foot, which is produced by smartly tapping
the tendon below the knee-pan when the leg hangs over
the other knee. Drs. Weir Mitchell and Lombard have
found that when other sensations come in simultaneously
with the tap, the jerk is increased.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Heat, cold, pricking,
itching, or faradic stimulation of the skin, sometimes strong
optical impressions, music, all have this dynamogenic effect,
which also results whenever voluntary movements are set
up in other parts of the body, simultaneously with the
tap.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>These 'dynamogenic' effects, in which one stimulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
simply reinforces another already under way, must not be
confounded with reflex acts properly so called, in which new
activities are originated by the stimulus. All instinctive
performances and manifestations of emotion are reflex acts.
But underneath those of which we are conscious there seem
to go on continually others smaller in amount, which
probably in most persons might be called fluctuations of
muscular <i>tone</i>, but which in certain neurotic subjects can
be demonstrated ocularly. M. Féré figures some of them
in the article to which I have already referred.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>Looking back over all these facts, it is hard to doubt the
truth of the law of diffusion, even where verification is beyond
reach. <i>A process set up anywhere in the centres reverberates
everywhere, and in some way or other affects the organism
throughout, making its activities either greater or less.</i> We
are brought again to the assimilation which was expressed
on a previous page of the nerve-central mass to a good conductor
charged with electricity, of which the tension cannot
be changed anywhere without changing it everywhere.</p>

<p>Herr Schneider has tried to show, by an ingenious and
suggestive zoological review,<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> that all the <i>special</i> movements
which highly evolved animals make are differentiated from
the two originally simple movements, of contraction and expansion,
in which the entire body of simple organisms takes
part. The tendency to contract is the source of all the
self-protective impulses and reactions which are later developed,
including that of flight. The tendency to expand
splits up, on the contrary, into the impulses and instincts of
an aggressive kind, feeding, fighting, sexual intercourse, etc.
Schneider's articles are well worth reading, if only for the
careful observations on animals which they embody. I cite
them here as a sort of evolutionary reason to add to the
mechanical <i>a priori</i> reason why there <i>ought</i> to be the
diffusive wave which our <i>a posteriori</i> instances have shown
to exist.</p>

<p>I will now proceed to a detailed study of the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
important classes of movement consequent upon cerebro-mental
change. They may be enumerated as&mdash;</p>

<p>1) Instinctive or Impulsive Performances;</p>

<p>2) Expressions of Emotion; and</p>

<p>3) Voluntary Deeds;</p>

<p>and each shall have a chapter to itself.</p>

<h4>INSTINCT.</h4>


<p><i>Instinct is usually defined as the faculty of acting in such a
way as to produce certain ends, without foresight of the ends,
and without previous education in the performance.</i> That
instincts, as thus defined, exist on an enormous scale in the
animal kingdom needs no proof. They are the functional
correlatives of structure. With the presence of a certain
organ goes, one may say, almost always a native aptitude
for its use.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Has the bird a gland for the secretion of oil? She knows instinctively
how to press the oil from the gland, and apply it to the feather.
Has the rattlesnake the grooved tooth and gland of poison? He knows
without instruction how to make both structure and function most effective
against his enemies. Has the silk-worm the function of secreting
the fluid silk? At the proper time she winds the cocoon such as she
has never seen, as thousands before have done; and thus without instruction,
pattern, or experience, forms a safe abode for herself in the
period of transformation. Has the hawk talons? She knows by instinct
how to wield them effectively against the helpless quarry."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A very common way of talking about these admirably
definite tendencies to act is by naming abstractly the purpose
they subserve, such as self-preservation, or defence, or
care for eggs and young&mdash;and saying the animal has an instinctive
fear of death or love of life, or that she has an instinct
of self-preservation, or an instinct of maternity and
the like. But this represents the animal as obeying abstractions
which not once in a million cases is it possible it
can have framed. The strict physiological way of interpreting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
the facts leads to far clearer results. <i>The actions we call
instinctive all conform to the general reflex type;</i> they are called
forth by determinate sensory stimuli in contact with the
animal's body, or at a distance in his environment. The
cat runs after the mouse, runs or shows fight before the
dog, avoids falling from walls and trees, shuns fire and
water, etc., not because he has any notion either of life or
of death, or of self, or of preservation. He has probably attained
to no one of these conceptions in such a way as to react
definitely upon it. He acts in each case separately,
and simply because he cannot help it; being so framed that
when that particular running thing called a mouse appears
in his field of vision he <i>must</i> pursue; that when that particular
barking and obstreperous thing called a dog appears
there he <i>must</i> retire, if at a distance, and scratch if close by;
that he <i>must</i> withdraw his feet from water and his face
from flame, etc. His nervous system is to a great extent a
preorganized bundle of such reactions&mdash;they are as fatal as
sneezing, and as exactly correlated to their special excitants
as it is to its own. Although the naturalist may, for his own
convenience, class these reactions under general heads, he
must not forget that in the animal it is a particular sensation
or perception, or image which calls them forth.</p>

<p>At first this view astounds us by the enormous number
of special adjustments it supposes animals to possess ready-made
in anticipation of the outer things among which they
are to dwell. <i>Can</i> mutual dependence be so intricate and
go so far? Is each thing born fitted to particular other
things, and to them exclusively, as locks are fitted to their
keys? Undoubtedly this must be believed to be so. Each
nook and cranny of creation, down to our very skin and
entrails, has its living inhabitants, with organs suited to
the place, to devour and digest the food it harbors and to
meet the dangers it conceals; and the minuteness of adaptation
thus shown in the way of <i>structure</i> knows no bounds.
Even so are there no bounds to the minuteness of adaptation
in the way of <i>conduct</i> which the several inhabitants
display.</p>

<p>The older writings on instinct are ineffectual wastes of
words, because their authors never came down to this definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
and simple point of view, but smothered everything in
vague wonder at the clairvoyant and prophetic power of
the animals&mdash;so superior to anything in man&mdash;and at the
beneficence of God in endowing them with such a gift. But
God's beneficence endows them, first of all, with a nervous
system; and, turning our attention to this, makes instinct
immediately appear neither more nor less wonderful than
all the other facts of life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Every instinct is an impulse.</i> Whether we shall call such
impulses as blushing, sneezing, coughing, smiling, or dodging,
or keeping time to music, instincts or not, is a mere
matter of terminology. The process is the same throughout.
In his delightfully fresh and interesting work, Der
Thierische Wille, Herr G. H. Schneider subdivides impulses
(<i>Triebe</i>) into sensation-impulses, perception-impulses,
and idea-impulses. To crouch from cold is a sensation-impulse;
to turn and follow, if we see people running
one way, is a perception-impulse; to cast about for
cover, if it begins to blow and rain, is an imagination-impulse.
A single complex instinctive action may involve
successively the awakening of impulses of all three classes.
Thus a hungry lion starts to <i>seek</i> prey by the awakening in
him of imagination coupled with desire; he begins to <i>stalk</i>
it when, on eye, ear, or nostril, he gets an impression of its
presence at a certain distance; he <i>springs</i> upon it, either
when the booty takes alarm and flees, or when the distance
is sufficiently reduced; he proceeds to <i>tear</i> and <i>devour</i> it
the moment he gets a sensation of its contact with his
claws and fangs. Seeking, stalking, springing, and devouring
are just so many different kinds of muscular contraction,
and neither kind is called forth by the stimulus appropriate
to the other.</p>

<p>Schneider says of the hamster, which stores corn in its
hole:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If we analyze the propensity of storing, we find that it consists of
three impulses: First, an impulse to <i>pick up</i> the nutritious object, due
to perception; second, an impulse to <i>carry it off</i> into the dwelling-place,
due to the idea of this latter; and third, an impulse to <i>lay it down</i>
there, due to the sight of the place. It lies in the nature of the hamster
that it should never see a full ear of corn without feeling a desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
to strip it; it lies in its nature to feel, as soon as its cheek-pouches are
filled, an irresistible desire to hurry to its home; and finally, it lies in
its nature that the sight of the storehouse should awaken the impulse
to empty the cheeks" (p. 208).</p></blockquote>

<p>In certain animals of a low order the feeling of having
executed one impulsive step is such an indispensable part
of the stimulus of the next one, that the animal cannot
make any variation in the order of its performance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Now, why do the various animals do what seem to us such
strange things,</i> in the presence of such outlandish stimuli?
Why does the hen, for example, submit herself to the
tedium of incubating such a fearfully uninteresting set of
objects as a nestful of eggs, unless she have some sort of a
prophetic inkling of the result? The only answer is <i>ad
hominem</i>. We can only interpret the instincts of brutes by
what we know of instincts in ourselves. Why do men always
lie down, when they can, on soft beds rather than on
hard floors? Why do they sit round the stove on a cold
day? Why, in a room, do they place themselves, ninety-nine
times out of a hundred, with their faces towards its
middle rather than to the wall? Why do they prefer saddle
of mutton and champagne to hard-tack and ditch-water?
Why does the maiden interest the youth so that everything
about her seems more important and significant than anything
else in the world? Nothing more can be said than
that these are human ways, and that every creature <i>likes</i> its
own ways, and takes to the following them as a matter of
course. Science may come and consider these ways, and
find that most of them are useful. But it is not for the
sake of their utility that they are followed, but because at
the moment of following them we feel that that is the only
appropriate and natural thing to do. Not one man in a
billion, when taking his dinner, ever thinks of utility. He
eats because the food tastes good and makes him want
more. If you ask him <i>why</i> he should want to eat more of
what tastes like that, instead of revering you as a philosopher
he will probably laugh at you for a fool. The connection
between the savory sensation and the act it awakens
is for him absolute and <i>selbstverständlich</i>, an '<i>a priori</i> synthesis'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
of the most perfect sort, needing no proof but its
own evidence. It takes, in short, what Berkeley calls a
mind debauched by learning to carry the process of making
the natural seem strange, so far as to ask for the <i>why</i> of any
instinctive human act. To the metaphysician alone can
such questions occur as: Why do we smile, when pleased,
and not scowl? Why are we unable to talk to a crowd
as we talk to a single friend? Why does a particular
maiden turn our wits so upside-down? The common man
can only say, "<i>Of course</i> we smile, <i>of course</i> our heart palpitates
at the sight of the crowd, <i>of course</i> we love the maiden,
that beautiful soul clad in that perfect form, so palpably
and flagrantly made from all eternity to be loved!"</p>

<p>And so, probably, does each animal feel about the particular
things it tends to do in presence of particular objects.
They, too, are <i>a priori</i> syntheses. To the lion it is
the lioness which is made to be loved; to the bear, the she-bear.
To the broody hen the notion would probably seem
monstrous that there should be a creature in the world to
whom a nestful of eggs was not the utterly fascinating and
precious and never-to-be-too-much-sat-upon object which
it is to her.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>Thus we may be sure that, however mysterious some
animals' instincts may appear to us, our instincts will appear
no less mysterious to them. And we may conclude that, to
the animal which obeys it, every impulse and every step of
every instinct shines with its own sufficient light, and seems
at the moment the only eternally right and proper thing to
do. It is done for its own sake exclusively. What voluptuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
thrill may not shake a fly, when she at last discovers
the one particular leaf, or carrion, or bit of dung, that out
of all the world can stimulate her ovipositor to its discharge?
Does not the discharge then seem to her the only
fitting thing? And need she care or know anything about
the future maggot and its food?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the <i>egg-laying instincts</i> are simple examples to consider,
a few quotations about them from Schneider may be
serviceable:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The phenomenon so often talked about, so variously interpreted,
so surrounded with mystification, that an insect should always lay her
eggs in a spot appropriate to the nourishment of her young, is no more
marvellous than the phenomenon that every animal pairs with a mate
capable of bearing posterity, or feeds on materials capable of affording
him nourishment.... Not only the choice of a place for laying the
eggs, but all the various acts for depositing and protecting them, are
occasioned by the perception of the proper object, and the relation of
this perception to the various stages of maternal impulse. When the
burying beetle perceives a carrion, she is not only impelled to approach
it and lodge her eggs in it, but also to go through the movements requisite
for burying it; just us a bird who sees his hen-bird is impelled
to caress her, to strut around her, dance before her, or in some other
way to woo her; just as a tiger, when he sees an antelope, is impelled
to stalk it, to pounce upon it, and to strangle it. When the tailor-bee
cuts out pieces of rose-leaf, bends them, carries them into a caterpillar- or
mouse-hole in trees or in the earth, covers their seams again with
other pieces, and so makes a thimble-shaped case&mdash;when she fills this
with honey and lays an egg in it, all these various appropriate expressions
of her will are to be explained by supposing that at the time when
the eggs are ripe within her, the appearance of a suitable caterpillar- or
mouse-hole and the perception of rose-leaves are so correlated in the
insect with the several impulses in question, that the performances follow
as a matter of course when the perceptions take place....</p>

<p>"The perception of the empty nest, or of a single egg, seems in birds
to stand in such a close relation to the physiological functions of oviparation,
that it serves as a direct stimulus to these functions, while the
perception of a sufficient number of eggs has just the opposite effect.
It is well known that hens and ducks lay more eggs if we keep removing
them than if we leave them in the nest. The impulse to sit arises,
as a rule, when a bird sees a certain number of eggs in her nest. If
this number is not yet to be seen there, the ducks continue to lay,
although they perhaps have laid twice as many eggs as they are accustomed
to sit upon.... That sitting, also, is independent of any idea of
purpose and is a pure perception-impulse is evident, among other things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
from the fact that many birds, e.g. wild ducks, steal eggs from each
other.... The bodily disposition to sit is, it is true, one condition
[since broody hens will sit where there are no eggs], but the
perception of the eggs is the other condition of the activity of
the incubating impulse. The propensity of the cuckoo and of the
cow-bird to lay their eggs in the nests of other species must also be
interpreted as a pure perception-impulse. These birds have no bodily
disposition to become broody, and there is therefore in them no connection
between the perception of an egg and the impulse to sit upon it.
Eggs ripen, however, in their oviducts, and the body tends to get rid of
them. And since the two birds just named do not drop their eggs anywhere
on the ground, but in nests, which are the only places where they
may preserve the species, it might easily appear that such preservation
of the species was what they had in view, and that they acted with full
consciousness of the purpose. But this is not so.... The cuckoo is
simply excited by the perception of quite determinate sorts of nest,
which already contain eggs, to drop her own into them, and throw the
others out, because this perception is a direct stimulus to these acts.
It is impossible that she should have any notion of the other bird coming
and sitting on her egg."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p></blockquote>


<h4>INSTINCTS NOT ALWAYS BLIND OR INVARIABLE.</h4>


<p>Remember that nothing is said yet of the origin of instincts,
but only of the constitution of those that exist fully
formed. How stands it with the instincts of mankind?</p>

<p>Nothing is commoner than the remark that Man differs
from lower creatures by the almost total absence of instincts,
and the assumption of their work in him by 'reason.' A
fruitless discussion might be waged on this point by two
theorizers who were careful not to define their terms.
'Reason' might be used, as it often has been, since Kant,
not as the mere power of 'inferring,' but also as a name for
the <i>tendency to obey impulses</i> of a certain lofty sort, such as
duty, or universal ends. And 'instinct' might have its significance
so broadened as to cover all impulses whatever,
even the impulse to act from the idea of a distant fact, as
well as the impulse to act from a present sensation. Were
the word instinct used in this broad way, it would of course
be impossible to restrict it, as we began by doing, to actions
done with no prevision of an end. We must of course
avoid a quarrel about words, and the facts of the case are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
really tolerably plain. Man has a far greater variety of
<i>impulses</i> than any lower animal; and any one of these impulses,
taken in itself, is as 'blind' as the lowest instinct
can be; but, owing to man's memory, power of reflection,
and power of inference, they come each one to be felt by
him, after he has once yielded to them and experienced
their results, in connection with a <i>foresight</i> of those results.
In this condition an impulse acted out may be said to be
acted out, in part at least, <i>for the sake</i> of its results. It is
obvious that <i>every instinctive act, in an animal with memory,
must cease to be 'blind' after being once repeated,</i> and must be
accompanied with foresight of its 'end' just so far as that
end may have fallen under the animal's cognizance. An
insect that lays her eggs in a place where she never sees
them hatched must always do so 'blindly;' but a hen who has
already hatched a brood can hardly be assumed to sit with
perfect 'blindness' on her second nest. Some expectation
of consequences must in every case like this be aroused;
and this expectation, according as it is that of something
desired or of something disliked, must necessarily either
re-enforce or inhibit the mere impulse. The hen's idea of
the chickens would probably encourage her to sit; a rat's
memory, on the other hand, of a former escape from a trap
would neutralize his impulse to take bait from anything
that reminded him of that trap. If a boy sees a fat hopping-toad,
he probably has incontinently an impulse (especially
if with other boys) to smash the creature with a stone,
which impulse we may suppose him blindly to obey. But
something in the expression of the dying toad's clasped
hands suggests the meanness of the act, or reminds him of
sayings he has heard about the sufferings of animals being
like his own; so that, when next he is tempted by a toad,
an idea arises which, far from spurring him again to the
torment, prompts kindly actions, and may even make him
the toad's champion against less reflecting boys.</p>

<p>It is plain, then, that, <i>no matter how well endowed an animal
may originally be in the way of instincts, his resultant actions
will be much modified if the instincts combine with experience,</i>
if in addition to impulses he have memories, associations,
inferences, and expectations, on any considerable scale. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
object O, on which he has an instinctive impulse to react in
the manner A, would <i>directly</i> provoke him to that reaction.
But O has meantime become for him a <i>sign</i> of the nearness
of P, on which he has an equally strong impulse to react in
the manner B, quite unlike A. So that when he meets O
the immediate impulse A and the remote impulse B struggle
in his breast for the mastery. The fatality and uniformity
said to be characteristic of instinctive actions will be
so little manifest that one might be tempted to deny to him
altogether the possession of any instinct about the object
O. Yet how false this judgment would be! The instinct
about O is there; only by the complication of the associative
machinery it has come into conflict with another instinct
about P.</p>

<p>Here we immediately reap the good fruits of our simple
physiological conception of what an instinct is. If it be a
mere excito-motor impulse, due to the pre-existence of a
certain 'reflex arc' in the nerve-centres of the creature, of
course it must follow the law of all such reflex arcs. One
liability of such arcs is to have their activity 'inhibited,' by
other processes going on at the same time. It makes no
difference whether the arc be organized at birth, or ripen
spontaneously later, or be due to acquired habit, it must
take its chances with all the other arcs, and sometimes
succeed, and sometimes fail, in drafting off the currents
through itself. The mystical view of an instinct would
make it invariable. The physiological view would require
it to show occasional irregularities in any animal in whom
the number of separate instincts, and the possible entrance
of the same stimulus into several of them, were great. And
such irregularities are what every superior animal's instincts
do show in abundance.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>Wherever the mind is elevated enough to discriminate;
wherever several distinct sensory elements must combine
to discharge the reflex-arc; wherever, instead of plumping
into action instantly at the first rough intimation of what
<i>sort</i> of a thing is there, the agent waits to see which <i>one</i> of
its kind it is and what the <i>circumstances</i> are of its appearance;
wherever different individuals and different circumstances
can impel him in different ways; wherever these are the
conditions&mdash;we have a masking of the elementary constitution
of the instinctive life. The whole story of our dealings
with the lower wild animals is the history of our taking
advantage of the way in which they judge of everything by
its mere label, as it were, so as to ensnare or kill them.
Nature, in them, has left matters in this rough way, and
made them act <i>always</i> in the manner which would be
<i>oftenest</i> right. There are more worms unattached to hooks
than impaled upon them; therefore, on the whole, says
Nature to her fishy children, bite at <i>every</i> worm and take
your chances. But as her children get higher, and their
lives more precious, she reduces the risks. Since what
seems to be the same object may be now a genuine food
and now a bait; since in gregarious species each individual
may prove to be either the friend or the rival, according to
the circumstances, of another; since any entirely unknown
object may be fraught with weal or woe, <i>Nature implants
contrary impulses to act on many classes of things,</i> and leaves
it to slight alterations in the conditions of the individual
case to decide which impulse shall carry the day. Thus,
greediness and suspicion, curiosity and timidity, coyness
and desire, bashfulness and vanity, sociability and pugnacity,
seem to shoot over into each other as quickly, and
to remain in as unstable equilibrium, in the higher birds
and mammals as in man. They are all impulses, congenital,
blind at first, and productive of motor reactions of a rigorously
determinate sort. <i>Each one of them, then, is an
instinct</i>, as instincts are commonly defined. <i>But they contradict
each other</i>&mdash;'experience' in each particular opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
of application usually deciding the issue. <i>The animal
that exhibits them, loses the 'instinctive' demeanor</i> and appears
to lead a life of hesitation and choice, an intellectual life;
<i>not, however, because he has no instincts&mdash;rather because he has
so many that they block each other's path.</i></p>

<p>Thus, then, without troubling ourselves about the words
instinct and reason, we may confidently say that however
uncertain man's reactions upon his environment may sometimes
seem in comparison with those of lower creatures, the
uncertainty is probably not due to their possession of any
principles of action which he lacks. <i>On the contrary, man
possesses all the impulses that they have, and a great many more
besides.</i> In other words, there is no material antagonism
between instinct and reason. Reason, <i>per se</i>, can inhibit
no impulses; the only thing that can neutralize an impulse
is an impulse the other way. Reason may, however, make
an <i>inference which will excite the imagination so as to set loose</i>
the impulse the other way; and thus, though the animal
richest in reason might be also the animal richest in instinctive
impulses too, he would never seem the fatal automaton
which a <i>merely</i> instinctive animal would be.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now turn to human impulses with a little more
detail. All we have ascertained so far is that impulses of
an originally instinctive character may exist, and yet not
betray themselves by automatic fatality of conduct. But
in man what impulses do exist? In the light of what has
been said, it is obvious that an existing impulse may not
always be superficially apparent even when its object is
there. And we shall see that some impulses may be masked
by causes of which we have not yet spoken.</p>


<h4>TWO PRINCIPLES OF NON-UNIFORMITY IN INSTINCTS.</h4>


<p>Were one devising an abstract scheme, nothing would
be easier than to discover from an animal's actions just how
many instincts he possessed. He would react in one way
only upon each class of objects with which his life had to
deal; he would react in identically the same way upon
every specimen of a class; and he would react invariably
during his whole life. There would be no gaps among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
instincts; all would come to light without perversion or
disguise. But there are no such abstract animals, and nowhere
does the instinctive life display itself in such a way.
Not only, as we have seen, may objects of the same class
arouse reactions of opposite sorts in consequence of slight
changes in the circumstances, in the individual object, or in
the agent's inward condition; but two other principles of
which we have not yet spoken, may come into play and
produce results so striking that observers as eminent as
Messrs. D. A. Spalding and Romanes do not hesitate to
call them 'derangements of the mental constitution,' and
to conclude that the instinctive machinery has got out
of gear.</p>

<p>These principles are those</p>

<p>1. Of the <i>inhibition of instincts by habits</i>; and</p>

<p>2. Of the <i>transitoriness of instincts</i>.</p>

<p>Taken in conjunction with the two former principles&mdash;that
the same object may excite ambiguous impulses, or <i>suggest</i>
an impulse different from that which it <i>excites</i>, by suggesting
a remote object&mdash;they explain any amount of departure
from uniformity of conduct, without implying any
getting out of gear of the elementary impulses from which
the conduct flows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. The law of inhibition of instincts by habits is this:
<i>When objects of a certain class elicit from an animal a certain
sort of reaction, it often happens that the animal becomes partial
to the first specimen of the class on which it has reacted, and will
not afterward react on any other specimen.</i></p>

<p>The selection of a particular hole to live in, of a particular
mate, of a particular feeding-ground, a particular variety
of diet, a particular anything, in short, out of a possible multitude,
is a very wide-spread tendency among animals, even
those low down in the scale. The limpet will return to the
same sticking-place in its rock, and the lobster to its favorite
nook on the sea-bottom. The rabbit will deposit its dung in
the same corner; the bird makes its nest on the same bough.
But each of these preferences carries with it an insensibility
to <i>other</i> opportunities and occasions&mdash;an insensibility which
can only be described physiologically as an inhibition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
new impulses by the habit of old ones already formed.
The possession of homes and wives of our own makes us
strangely insensible to the charms of those of other people.
Few of us are adventurous in the matter of food; in fact,
most of us think there is something disgusting in a bill of
fare to which we are unused. Strangers, we are apt to
think, cannot be worth knowing, especially if they come
from distant cities, etc. The original impulse which got us
homes, wives, dietaries, and friends at all, seems to exhaust
itself in its first achievements and to leave no surplus
energy for reacting on new cases. And so it comes about
that, witnessing this torpor, an observer of mankind might
say that no <i>instinctive</i> propensity toward certain objects existed
at all. It existed, but it existed <i>miscellaneously</i>, or as
an instinct pure and simple, only before habit was formed.
A habit, once grafted on an instinctive tendency, restricts
the range of the tendency itself, and keeps us from reacting
on any but the habitual object, although other objects
might just as well have been chosen had they been the first-comers.</p>

<p>Another sort of arrest of instinct by habit is where the
same class of objects awakens contrary instinctive impulses.
Here the impulse first followed toward a given individual
of the class is apt to keep him from ever awakening the
opposite impulse in us. In fact, the whole class may be
protected by this individual specimen from the application
to it of the other impulse. Animals, for example, awaken in
a child the opposite impulses of fearing and fondling. But
if a child, in his first attempts to pat a dog, gets snapped at
or bitten, so that the impulse of fear is strongly aroused, it
may be that for years to come no dog will excite in him the
impulse to fondle again. On the other hand, the greatest
natural enemies, if carefully introduced to each other when
young and guided at the outset by superior authority, settle
down into those 'happy families' of friends which we
see in our menageries. Young animals, immediately after
birth, have no instinct of fear, but show their dependence
by allowing themselves to be freely handled. Later, however,
they grow 'wild,' and, if left to themselves, will not
let man approach them. I am told by farmers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
Adirondack wilderness that it is a very serious matter if a
cow wanders off and calves in the woods and is not found
for a week or more. The calf, by that time, is as wild and
almost as fleet as a deer, and hard to capture without violence.
But calves rarely show any particular wildness to
the men who have been in contact with them during the
first days of their life, when the instinct to attach themselves
is uppermost, nor do they dread strangers as they
would if brought up wild.</p>

<p>Chickens give a curious illustration of the same law.
Mr. Spalding's wonderful article on instinct shall supply us
with the facts. These little creatures show opposite instincts
of attachment and fear, either of which may be
aroused by the same object, man. If a chick is born in the
absence of the hen, it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"will follow any moving object. And, when guided by sight alone,
they seem to have no more disposition to follow a hen than to follow a
duck or a human being. Unreflecting lookers-on, when they saw chickens
a day old running after me," says Mr. Spalding, "and older ones
following me for miles, and answering to my whistle, imagined that I
must have some occult power over the creatures: whereas I had simply
allowed them to follow me from the first. There is the instinct to follow;
and the ear, prior to experience, attaches them to the right object."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But if a man presents himself for the first time when
the instinct of <i>fear</i> is strong, the phenomena are altogether
reversed. Mr. Spalding kept three chickens hooded until
they were nearly four days old, and thus describes their
behavior:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Each of them, on being unhooded, evinced the greatest terror to
me, dashing off in the opposite direction whenever I sought to approach
it. The table on which they were unhooded stood before a window, and
each in its turn beat against the window like a wild bird. One of them
darted behind some books, and, squeezing itself into a corner, remained
cowering for a length of time. We might guess at the meaning of this
strange and exceptional wildness; but the odd fact is enough for my
present purpose. Whatever might have been the meaning of this
marked change in their mental constitution&mdash;had they been unhooded
on the previous day they would have run to me instead of from me&mdash;it
could not have been the effect of experience; it must have resulted
wholly from changes in their own organizations."<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>
<p>Their case was precisely analogous to that of the Adirondack
calves. The two opposite instincts relative to the
same object ripen in succession. If the first one engenders
a habit, that habit will inhibit the application of the second
instinct to that object. All animals are tame during the
earliest phase of their infancy. Habits formed then limit
the effects of whatever instincts of wildness may later be
evolved.</p>

<p>Mr. Romanes gives some very curious examples of the
way in which instinctive tendencies may be altered by the
habits to which their first 'objects' have given rise. The
cases are a little more complicated than those mentioned in
the text, inasmuch as the object reacted on not only starts
a habit which inhibits other kinds of impulse toward it (although
such other kinds might be natural), but even modifies
by its own peculiar conduct the constitution of the
impulse which it actually awakens.</p>

<p>Two of the instances in question are those of hens who
hatched out broods of chicks after having (in three previous
years) hatched ducks. They strove to coax or to compel
their new progeny to enter the water, and seemed much
perplexed at their unwillingness. Another hen adopted a
brood of young ferrets which, having lost their mother,
were put under her. During all the time they were left
with her she had to sit on the nest, for they could not wander
like young chicks. She obeyed their hoarse growling
as she would have obeyed her chickens' peep. She combed
out their hair with her bill, and "used frequently to stop
and look with one eye at the wriggling nestful, with an inquiring
gaze, expressive of astonishment." At other times
she would fly up with a loud scream, doubtless because the
orphans had nipped her in their search for teats. Finally,
a Brahma hen nursed a young peacock during the enormous
period of <i>eighteen months</i>, and never laid any eggs
during all this time. The abnormal degree of pride which
she showed in her wonderful chicken is described by Dr.
Romanes as ludicrous.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>
<p>2. This leads us to the <i>law of transitoriness</i>, which is
this: <i>Many instincts ripen at a certain age and then fade away.</i>
A consequence of this law is that if, during the time of
such an instinct's vivacity, objects adequate to arouse it are
met with, a <i>habit</i> of acting on them is formed, which remains
when the original instinct has passed away; but that
if no such objects are met with, then no habit will be
formed; and, later on in life, when the animal meets the
objects, he will altogether fail to react, as at the earlier
epoch he would instinctively have done.</p>

<p>No doubt such a law is restricted. Some instincts are
far less transient than others&mdash;those connected with feeding
and 'self-preservation' may hardly be transient at all,
and some, after fading out for a time, recur as strong as
ever, e.g., the instincts of pairing and rearing young. The
law, however, though not absolute, is certainly very widespread,
and a few examples will illustrate just what it
means.</p>

<p>In the chickens and calves above mentioned, it is obvious
that the instinct to follow and become attached fades
out after a few days, and that the instinct of flight then
takes its place, the conduct of the creature toward man being
decided by the formation or non-formation of a certain
habit during those days. The transiency of the chicken's
instinct to follow is also proved by its conduct toward the
hen. Mr. Spalding kept some chickens shut up till they
were comparatively old, and, speaking of these, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A chicken that has not heard the call of the mother till until eight
or ten days old then hears it as if it heard it not. I regret to find that
on this point my notes are not so full as I could wish, or as they might
have been. There is, however, an account of one chicken that could
not be returned to the mother when ten days old. The hen followed it,
and tried to entice it in every way; still, it continually left her and ran
to the house or to any person of whom it caught sight. This it persisted
in doing, though beaten back with a small branch dozens of
times, and, indeed, cruelly maltreated. It was also placed under the
mother at night, but it again left her in the morning."</p></blockquote>

<p>The instinct of sucking is ripe in all mammals at birth,
and leads to that habit of taking the breast which, in the
human infant, may be prolonged by daily exercise long beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
its usual term of a year or a year and a half. But the
instinct itself is transient, in the sense that if, for any reason,
the child be fed by spoon during the first few days of
its life and not put to the breast, it may be no easy matter
after that to make it suck at all. So of calves. If their
mother die, or be dry, or refuse to let them suck for a day
or two, so that they are fed by hand, it becomes hard to
get them to suck at all when a new nurse is provided. The
ease with which sucking creatures are weaned, by simply
breaking the habit and giving them food in a new way,
shows that the instinct, purely as such, must be entirely
extinct.</p>

<p>Assuredly the simple fact that instincts are transient,
and that the effect of later ones may be altered by the
habits which earlier ones have left behind, is a far more
philosophical explanation than the notion of an instinctive
constitution vaguely 'deranged' or 'thrown out of gear.'</p>

<p>I have observed a Scotch terrier, born on the floor of a
stable in December, and transferred six weeks later to a
carpeted house, make, when he was less than four months
old, a very elaborate pretence of burying things, such as
gloves, etc., with which he had played till he was tired.
He scratched the carpet with his forefeet, dropped the object
from his mouth upon the spot, and then scratched all
about it (with both fore-and hind-feet, if I remember
rightly), and finally went away and let it lie. Of course, the
act was entirely useless. I saw him perform it at that age,
some four or five times, and never again in his life. The
conditions were not present to fix a habit which should last
when the prompting instinct died away. But suppose
meat instead of a glove, earth instead of a carpet, hunger-pangs
instead of a fresh supper a few hours later, and it is
easy to see how this dog might have got into a habit of
burying superfluous food, which might have lasted all his
life. Who can swear that the strictly instructive part of
the food-burying propensity in the wild <i>Canidæ</i> may not be
as short-lived as it was in this terrier?</p>

<p>A similar instance is given by Dr. H. D. Schmidt<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> of
New Orleans:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"I may cite the example of a young squirrel which I had tamed, a
number of years ago, when serving in the army, and when I had sufficient
leisure and opportunity to study the habits of animals. In the
autumn, before the winter sets in, adult squirrels bury as many nuts
as they can collect, separately, in the ground. Holding the nut firmly
between their teeth, they first scratch a hole in the ground, and, after
pointing their ears in all directions to convince themselves that no
enemy is near, they ram&mdash;the head, with the nut still between the front
teeth, serving as a sledge-hammer&mdash;the nut into the ground, and then fill
up the hole by means of their paws. The whole process is executed with
great rapidity, and, as it appeared to me, always with exactly the same
movements; in fact, it is done so well that I could never discover the
traces of the burial-ground. Now, as regards the young squirrel, which,
of course, never had been present at the burial of a nut, I observed that,
after having eaten a number of hickory-nuts to appease its appetite, it
would take one between its teeth, then sit upright and listen in all
directions. Finding all right, it would scratch upon the smooth blanket
on which I was playing with it as if to make a hole, then hammer with
the nut between its teeth upon the blanket, and finally perform all the
motions required to fill up a hole<i>&mdash;in the air</i>; after which it would
jump away, leaving the nut, of course, uncovered."</p></blockquote>

<p>The anecdote, of course, illustrates beautifully the close
relation of instinct to reflex action&mdash;a particular perception
calls forth particular movements, and that is all. Dr.
Schmidt writes me that the squirrel in question soon passed
away from his observation. It may fairly be presumed
that, if he had been long retained prisoner in a cage, he
would soon have forgotten his gesticulations over the hickory-nuts.</p>

<p>One might, indeed, go still further with safety, and expect
that, if such a captive squirrel were then set free, he
would never afterwards acquire this peculiar instinct of his
tribe.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Leaving lower animals aside, and turning to human instincts,
we see the law of transiency corroborated on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
widest scale by the alternation of different interests and
passions as human life goes on. With the child, life is all
play and fairy-tales and learning the external properties of
'things;' with the youth, it is bodily exercises of a more
systematic sort, novels of the real world, boon-fellowship
and song, friendship and love, nature, travel and adventure,
science and philosophy; with the man, ambition and
policy, acquisitiveness, responsibility to others, and the
selfish zest of the battle of life. If a boy grows up alone
at the age of games and sports, and learns neither to play
ball, nor row, nor sail, nor ride, nor skate, nor fish, nor
shoot, probably he will be sedentary to the end of his days;
and, though the best of opportunities be afforded him for
learning these things later, it is a hundred to one but he will
pass them by and shrink back from the effort of taking
those necessary first steps the prospect of which, at an
earlier age, would have filled him with eager delight. The
sexual passion expires after a protracted reign; but it is
well known that its peculiar manifestations in a given individual
depend almost entirely on the habits he may form
during the early period of its activity. Exposure to bad
company then makes him a loose liver all his days;
chastity kept at first makes the same easy later on. In all
pedagogy the great thing is to strike the iron while hot,
and to seize the wave of the pupil's interest in each successive
subject before its ebb has come, so that knowledge
may be got and a habit of skill acquired&mdash;a headway of interest,
in short, secured, on which afterward the individual
may float. There is a happy moment for fixing skill in
drawing, for making boys collectors in natural history, and
presently dissectors and botanists; then for initiating them
into the harmonies of mechanics and the wonders of physical
and chemical law. Later, introspective psychology
and the metaphysical and religious mysteries take their
turn; and, last of all, the drama of human affairs and
worldly wisdom in the widest sense of the term. In each
of us a saturation-point is soon reached in all these things;
the impetus of our purely intellectual zeal expires, and unless
the topic be one associated with some urgent personal
need that keens our wits constantly whetted about it, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
settle into an equilibrium, and live on what we learned
when our interest was fresh and instinctive, without adding
to the store. Outside of their own business, the ideas
gained by men before they are twenty-five are practically
the only ideas they shall have in their lives. They <i>cannot</i>
get anything new. Disinterested curiosity is past, the
mental grooves and channels set, the power of assimilation
gone. If by chance we ever do learn anything about some
entirely new topic we are afflicted with a strange sense of
insecurity, and we fear to advance a resolute opinion. But,
with things learned in the plastic days of instinctive curiosity
we never lose entirely our sense of being at home.
There remains a kinship, a sentiment of intimate acquaintance,
which, even when we know we have failed to keep
abreast of the subject, flatters us with a sense of power
over it, and makes us feel not altogether out of the pale.</p>

<p>Whatever individual exceptions might be cited to this
are of the sort that 'prove the rule.'</p>

<p>To detect the moment of the instinctive readiness for
the subject is, then, the first duty of every educator. As
for the pupils, it would probably lead to a more earnest
temper on the part of college students if they had less belief
in their unlimited future intellectual potentialities, and
could be brought to realize that whatever physics and political
economy and philosophy they are now acquiring are, for
better or worse, the physics and political economy and
philosophy that will have to serve them to the end.</p>

<p>The natural conclusion to draw from this transiency of
instincts is that <i>most instincts are implanted for the sake of
giving rise to habits, and that, this purpose once accomplished,
the instincts themselves, as such, have no raison d'être in the
psychical economy, and consequently fade away.</i> That occasionally
an instinct should fade before circumstances permit
of a habit being formed, or that, if the habit be formed,
other factors than the pure instinct should modify its
course, need not surprise us. Life is full of the imperfect
adjustment to individual cases, of arrangements which, taking
the species as a whole, are quite orderly and regular.
Instinct cannot be expected to escape this general risk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>


<h4>SPECIAL HUMAN INSTINCTS.</h4>


<p>Let us now test our principles by turning to human
instincts in more detail. We cannot pretend in these pages
to be minute or exhaustive. But we can say enough to set
all the above generalities in a more favorable light. But
first, what kind of motor reactions upon objects shall we
count as instincts? This, as aforesaid, is a somewhat
arbitrary matter. Some of the actions aroused in us by
objects go no further than our own bodies. Such is the
bristling up of the attention when a novel object is perceived,
or the 'expression' on the face or the breathing
apparatus of an emotion it may excite. These movements
merge into ordinary reflex actions like laughing when
tickled, or making a wry face at a bad taste. Other actions
take effect upon the outer world. Such are flight from a
wild beast, imitation of what we see a comrade do, etc. On
the whole it is best to be catholic, since it is very hard to
draw an exact line; and call both of these kinds of activity
instinctive, so far as either may be <i>naturally</i> provoked by
the presence of specific sorts of outward fact.</p>

<p>Professor Preyer, in his careful little work, 'Die Seele
des Kindes,' says "instinctive acts are in man few in
number, and, apart from those connected with the sexual
passion, difficult to recognize after early youth is past."
And he adds, "so much the more attention should we pay
to the instinctive movements of new-born babies, sucklings,
and small children." That instinctive acts should be
easiest <i>recognized</i> in childhood would be a very natural
effect of our principles of transitoriness, and of the restrictive
influence of habits once acquired; but we shall see how
far they are from being 'few in number' in man. Professor
Preyer divides the movements of infants into <i>impulsive,
reflex,</i> and instinctive. By impulsive movements he means
<i>random</i> movements of limbs, body, and voice, with no aim,
and before perception is aroused. Among the first reflex
movements are crying on contact with the air, <i>sneezing,
snuffling, snoring, coughing, sighing, sobbing, gagging, vomiting,
hiccuping, starting, moving the limbs when tickled, touched, or
blown upon,</i> etc., etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>
<p>Of the movements called by him instinctive in the child,
Professor Preyer gives a full account. Herr Schneider does
the same; and as their descriptions agree with each other
and with what other writers about infancy say, I will base
my own very brief statement on theirs.</p>

<p><i>Sucking</i>: almost perfect at birth; not coupled with any
congenital tendency to <i>seek</i> the breast, this being a later
acquisition. As we have seen, sucking is a transitory instinct.</p>

<p><i>Biting</i> an object placed in the mouth, <i>chewing</i> and <i>grinding
the teeth; licking</i> sugar; making characteristic <i>grimaces</i>
over bitter and sweet tastes; <i>spitting</i> out.</p>

<p><i>Clasping</i> an object which touches the fingers or toes.
Later, attempts to <i>grasp</i> at an object seen at a distance.
<i>Pointing at</i> such objects, and making a peculiar <i>sound expressive
of desire</i>, which, in my own three children, was the
first manifestation of speech, occurring many weeks before
other significant sounds.</p>

<p><i>Carrying to the mouth</i> of the object, when grasped. This
instinct, guided and inhibited by the sense of taste, and
combined with the instincts of biting, chewing, sucking,
spitting-out, etc., and with the reflex act of swallowing,
leads in the individual to a set of habits which constitute
his <i>function of alimentation</i>, and which may or may not be
gradually modified as life goes on.</p>

<p><i>Crying</i> at bodily discomfort, hunger, or pain, and at
solitude. <i>Smiling</i> at being noticed, fondled, or smiled at
by others. It seems very doubtful whether young infants
have any instinctive fear of a terrible or scowling face. I
have been unable to make my own children, under a year
old, change their expression when I changed mine; at most
they manifested attention or curiosity. Preyer instances a
<i>protrusion of the lips</i>, which, he says, may be so great as to
remind one of that in the chimpanzee, as an instinctive
expression of concentrated attention in the human infant.</p>

<p><i>Turning the head aside</i> as a gesture of rejection, a gesture
usually accompanied with a frown and a bending back of
the body, and with holding the breath.</p>

<p><i>Holding head erect.</i></p>

<p><i>Sitting up.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Standing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Locomotion</i>. The early movements of children's limbs
are more or less symmetrical. Later a baby will move his
legs in alternation if suspended in the air. But until the
impulse to walk awakens by the natural ripening of the
nerve-centres, it seems to make no difference how often the
child's feet may be placed in contact with the ground; the
legs remain limp, and do not respond to the sensation of
contact in the soles by muscular contractions <i>pressing downwards</i>.
No sooner, however, is the standing impulse born,
than the child stiffens his legs and presses downward as
soon as he feels the floor. In some babies this is the first
locomotory reaction. In others it is preceded by the instinct
to <i>creep</i>, which arises, as I can testify, often in a very
sudden way. Yesterday the baby sat quite contentedly
wherever he was put; to-day it has become impossible to
keep him sitting at all, so irresistible is the impulse, aroused
by the sight of the floor, to throw himself forward upon his
hands. Usually the arms are too weak, and the ambitious
little experimenter falls on his nose. But his perseverance
is dauntless, and he ends in a few days by learning to travel
rapidly around the room in the quadrupedal way. The
position of the legs in 'creeping' varies much from one
child to another. My own child, when creeping, was often
observed to pick up objects from the floor with his mouth,
a phenomenon which, as Dr. O. W. Holmes has remarked,
like the early tendency to grasp with the toes, easily lends
itself to interpretation as a reminiscence of prehuman ancestral
habits.</p>

<p>The walking instinct may awaken with no less suddenness,
and its entire education be completed within a week's
compass, barring, of course, a little 'grogginess' in the
gait. Individual infants vary enormously; but on the whole
it is safe to say that the mode of development of these
locomotor instincts is inconsistent with the account given
by the older English associationist school, of their being
results of the individual's education, due altogether to the
gradual association of certain perceptions with certain haphazard
movements and certain resultant pleasures. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
Bain has tried,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> by describing the demeanor of new-born
lambs, to show that locomotion is <i>learned</i> by a very rapid
experience. But the observation recorded proves the
faculty to be almost perfect from the first; and all others
who have observed new-born calves, lambs, and pigs agree
that in these animals the powers of standing and walking,
and of interpreting the topographical significance of sights
and sounds, are all but fully developed at birth. Often in
animals who seem to be 'learning' to walk or fly the semblance
is illusive. The awkwardness shown is not due to
the fact that 'experience' has not yet been there to associate
the successful movements and exclude the failures, but
to the fact that the animal is beginning his attempts before
the co-ordinating centres have quite ripened for their work.
Mr. Spalding's observations on this point are conclusive as
to birds.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Birds," he says, "do not <i>learn</i> to fly. Two years ago I shut up
five unfledged swallows in a small box, not much larger than the nest
from which they were taken. The little box, which had a wire front,
was hung on the wall near the nest, and the young swallows were fed by
their parents through the wires. In this confinement, where they could
not even extend their wings, they were kept until after they were fully
fledged.... On going to set the prisoners free, one was found
dead.... The remaining four were allowed to escape one at a time.
Two of these were perceptibly wavering and unsteady in their flight.
One of them, after a flight of some ninety yards, disappeared among
some trees." No. 3 and No. 4 "never flew against anything, nor was
there, in their avoiding objects, any appreciable difference between
them and the old birds. No. 3 swept round the Wellingtonia, and No.
4 rose over the hedge, just as we see the old swallows doing every hour
of the day. I have this summer verified these observations. Of two
swallows I had similarly confined, one, on being set free, flew a yard or
two close to the ground, rose in the direction of a beech-tree, which it
gracefully avoided; it was seen for a considerable time sweeping round
the beeches and performing magnificent evolutions in the air high above
them. The other, which was observed to beat the air with its wings
more than usual, was soon lost to sight, behind some trees. Titmice,
tomtits, and wrens I have made the subjects of similar observations, and
with similar results."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the light of this report, one may well be tempted to
make a prediction about the human child, and say that if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
baby were kept from getting on his feet for two or three
weeks after the first impulse to walk had shown itself in
him,&mdash;a small blister on each sole would do the business,&mdash;he
might then be expected to walk about as well, through
the mere ripening of his nerve-centres, as if the ordinary
process of 'learning' had been allowed to occur during all
the blistered time. It is to be hoped that some scientific
widower, left alone with his offspring at the critical moment,
may ere long test this suggestion on the living subject.
<i>Climbing</i> on trees, fences, furniture, banisters, etc., is a well-marked
instinctive propensity which ripens after the fourth
year.</p>

<p><i>Vocalization.</i> This may be either musical or significant.
Very few weeks after birth the baby begins to express its
spirits by emitting vowel sounds, as much during inspiration
as during expiration, and will lie on its back cooing
and gurgling to itself for nearly an hour. But this singing
has nothing to do with speech. Speech is sound <i>significant</i>.
During the second year a certain number of significant
sounds are gradually acquired; but talking proper does not
set in till the instinct to <i>imitate sounds</i> ripens in the nervous
system; and this ripening seems in some children to be
quite abrupt. Then speech grows rapidly in extent and
perfection. The child imitates every word he hears uttered,
and repeats it again and again with the most evident pleasure
at his new power. At this time it is quite impossible
to talk <i>with</i> him, for his condition is that of 'Echolalia,'&mdash;instead
of answering the question, he simply reiterates it.
The result is, however, that his vocabulary increases very
fast; and little by little, with teaching from above, the
young prattler understands, puts words together to express
his own wants and perceptions, and even makes intelligent
replies. From a speechless, he has become a speaking,
animal. The interesting point with regard to this instinct
is the oftentimes very sudden birth of the impulse to imitate
sounds. Up to the date of its awakening the child may
have been as devoid of it as a dog. Four days later his
whole energy may be poured into this new channel. The
habits of articulation formed during the plastic age of
childhood are in most persons sufficient to inhibit the formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
of new ones of a fundamentally different sort&mdash;witness
the inevitable 'foreign accent' which distinguishes
the speech of those who learn a language after early youth.</p>

<p><i>Imitation.</i> The child's first words are in part vocables
of his own invention, which his parents adopt, and which,
as far as they go, form a new human tongue upon the earth;
and in part they are his more or less successful imitations
of words he hears the parents use. But the instinct of
<i>imitating gestures</i> develops earlier than that of imitating
sounds,&mdash;unless the sympathetic crying of a baby when it
hears another cry may be reckoned as imitation of a sound.
Professor Preyer speaks of his child imitating the protrusion
of the father's lips in its fifteenth week. The various
accomplishments of infancy, making 'pat-a-cake,' saying
'bye-bye,' 'blowing out the candle,' etc., usually fall well
inside the limits of the first year. Later come all the various
imitative games in which childhood revels, playing 'horse,'
'soldiers,' etc., etc. And from this time onward man is
essentially <i>the</i> imitative animal. His whole educability
and in fact the whole history of civilization depend on
this trait, which his strong tendencies to rivalry, jealousy,
and acquisitiveness reinforce. '<i>Humani nihil a me alienum
puto</i>,' is the motto of each individual of the species; and
makes him, whenever another individual shows a power
or superiority of any kind, restless until he can exhibit it
himself. But apart from this kind of imitation, of which
the psychological roots are complex, there is the more
direct propensity to speak and walk and behave like
others, usually without any conscious intention of so
doing. And there is the imitative tendency which shows
itself in large masses of men, and produces panics, and
orgies, and frenzies of violence, and which only the
rarest individuals can actively withstand. This sort of
imitativeness is possessed by man in common with other
gregarious animals, and is an instinct in the fullest sense
of the term, being a blind impulse to act as soon as a certain
perception occurs. It is particularly hard not to imitate
gaping, laughing, or looking and running in a certain
direction, if we see others doing so. Certain mesmerized
subjects must automatically imitate whatever motion their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
operator makes before their eyes.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> A successful piece of
mimicry gives to both bystanders and mimic a peculiar
kind of æsthetic pleasure. The dramatic impulse, the tendency
to pretend one is someone else, contains this pleasure
of mimicry as one of its elements. Another element seems
to be a peculiar sense of power in stretching one's own
personality so as to include that of a strange person. In
young children this instinct often knows no bounds. For
a few months in one of my children's third year, he literally
hardly ever appeared in his own person. It was
always, "Play I am So-and-so, and you are So-and-so, and
the chair is such a thing, and then we'll do this or that."
If you called him by his name, H., you invariably got the
reply, "I'm not H., I'm a hyena, or a horse-car," or whatever
the feigned object might be. He outwore this impulse
after a time; but while it lasted, it had every appearance
of being the automatic result of ideas, often suggested by
perceptions, working out irresistible motor effects. Imitation
shades into</p>

<p><i>Emulation or Rivalry,</i> a very intense instinct, especially
rife with young children, or at least especially undisguised.
Everyone knows it. Nine-tenths of the work of the world
is done by it. We know that if we do not do the task someone
else will do it and get the credit, so we do it. It has
very little connection with sympathy, but rather more with
pugnacity, which we proceed in turn to consider.</p>

<p><i>Pugnacity; anger; resentment.</i> In many respects man
is the most ruthlessly ferocious of beasts. As with all
gregarious animals, 'two souls,' as Faust says, 'dwell within
his breast,' the one of sociability and helpfulness, the
other of jealousy and antagonism to his mates. Though in
a general way he cannot live without them, yet, as regards
certain individuals, it often falls out that he cannot live
with them either. Constrained to be a member of a tribe,
he still has a right to decide, as far as in him lies, of which
other members the tribe shall consist. Killing off a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
obnoxious ones may often better the chances of those that
remain. And killing off a neighboring tribe from whom
no good thing comes, but only competition, may materially
better the lot of the whole tribe. Hence the gory cradle,
the <i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i>, in which our race was
reared; hence the fickleness of human ties, the ease with
which the foe of yesterday becomes the ally of to-day, the
friend of to-day the enemy of to-morrow; hence the fact that
we, the lineal representatives of the successful enactors of
one scene of slaughter after another, must, whatever more
pacific virtues we may also possess, still carry about with
us, ready at any moment to burst into flame, the smouldering
and sinister traits of character by means of which they
lived through so many massacres, harming others, but
themselves unharmed.</p>

<p><i>Sympathy</i> is an emotion as to whose instinctiveness psychologists
have held hot debate, some of them contending
that it is no primitive endowment, but, originally at least,
the result of a rapid calculation of the good consequences
to ourselves of the sympathetic act. Such a calculation,
at first conscious, would grow more unconscious as it became
more habitual, and at last, tradition and association
aiding, might prompt to actions which could not be distinguished
from immediate impulses. It is hardly needful to
argue against the falsity of this view. Some forms of sympathy,
that of mother with child, for example, are surely
primitive, and not intelligent forecasts of board and lodging
and other support to be reaped in old age. Danger to
the child blindly and instantaneously stimulates the mother
to actions of alarm or defence. Menace or harm to the
adult beloved or friend excites us in a corresponding
way, often against all the dictates of prudence. It is true
that sympathy does not necessarily follow from the mere
fact of gregariousness. Cattle do not help a wounded comrade;
on the contrary, they are more likely to dispatch
him. But a dog will lick another sick dog, and even bring
him food; and the sympathy of monkeys is proved by
many observations to be strong. In man, then, we may lay
it down that the sight of suffering or danger to others is
a direct exciter of interest, and an immediate stimulus, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
no complication hinders, to acts of relief. There is nothing
unaccountable or pathological about this&mdash;nothing to
justify Professor Bain's assimilation of it to the 'fixed
ideas' of insanity, as 'clashing with the regular outgoings
of the will.' It may be as primitive as any other 'outgoing,'
and may be due to a random variation selected, quite
as probably as gregariousness and maternal love are, even
in Spencer's opinion, due to such variations.</p>

<p>It is true that sympathy is peculiarly liable to inhibition
from other instincts which its stimulus may call forth.
The traveller whom the good Samaritan rescued may well
have prompted such instinctive fear or disgust in the priest
and Levite who passed him by, that their sympathy could
not come to the front. Then, of course, habits, reasoned
reflections, and calculations may either check or reinforce
one's sympathy; as may also the instincts of love or hate,
if these exist, for the suffering individual. The hunting
and pugnacious instincts, when aroused, also inhibit our
sympathy absolutely. This accounts for the cruelty of
collections of men hounding each other on to bait or torture
a victim. The blood mounts to the eyes, and sympathy's
chance is gone.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p><i>The hunting instinct</i> has an equally remote origin in the
evolution of the race.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> The hunting and the fighting instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
combine in many manifestations. They both support
the emotion of anger; they combine in the fascination which
stories of atrocity have for most minds; and the utterly
blind excitement of giving the rein to our fury when our blood
is up (an excitement whose intensity is greater than that
of any other human passion save one) is only explicable as an
impulse aboriginal in character, and having more to do with
immediate and overwhelming tendencies to muscular discharge
than to any possible reminiscences of effects of experience,
or association of ideas. I say this here, because
the pleasure of disinterested cruelty has been thought a
paradox, and writers have sought to show that it is no
primitive attribute of our nature, but rather a resultant
of the subtile combination of other less malignant elements
of mind. This is a hopeless task. If evolution and
the survival of the fittest be true at all, the destruction
of prey and of human rivals <i>must</i> have been among the
most important of man's primitive functions, the fighting
and the chasing instincts <i>must</i> have become ingrained.
Certain perceptions <i>must</i> immediately, and without the intervention
of inferences and ideas, have prompted emotions
and motor discharges; and both the latter must, from
the nature of the case, have been very violent, and therefore,
when unchecked, of an intensely pleasurable kind. It is just
because human bloodthirstiness is such a primitive part of
us that it is so hard to eradicate, especially where a fight
or a hunt is promised as part of the fun.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>
<p>As Rochefoucauld says, there is something in the misfortunes
of our very friends that does not altogether displease
us; and an apostle of peace will feel a certain vicious thrill
run through him, and enjoy a vicarious brutality, as he turns
to the column in his newspaper at the top of which 'Shocking
Atrocity' stands printed in large capitals. See how the
crowd flocks round a street-brawl! Consider the enormous
annual sale of revolvers to persons, not one in a thousand
of whom has any serious intention of using them, but of
whom each one has his carnivorous self-consciousness
agreeably tickled by the notion, as he clutches the handle
of his weapon, that he will be rather a dangerous customer
to meet. See the ignoble crew that escorts every great
pugilist&mdash;parasites who feel as if the glory of his brutality
rubbed off upon them, and whose darling hope, from day to
day, is to arrange some set-to of which they may share the
rapture without enduring the pains! The first blows at a
prize-fight are apt to make a refined spectator sick; but his
blood is soon up in favor of one party, and it will then seem
as if the other fellow could not be banged and pounded and
mangled enough&mdash;the refined spectator would like to reinforce
the blows himself. Over the sinister orgies of blood
of certain depraved and insane persons let a curtain be
drawn, as well as over the ferocity with which otherwise
fairly decent men may be animated, when (at the sacking of
a town, for instance), the excitement of victory long delayed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
the sudden freedom of rapine and of lust, the contagion
of a crowd, and the impulse to imitate and outdo, all
combine to swell the blind drunkenness of the killing-instinct,
and carry it to its extreme. No! those who try to
account for this from above downwards, as if it resulted from
the consequences of the victory being rapidly inferred, and
from the agreeable sentiments associated with them in the
imagination, have missed the root of the matter. Our ferocity
is blind, and can only be explained from <i>below</i>. Could
we trace it back through our line of descent, we should see
it taking more and more the form of a fatal reflex response,
and at the same time becoming more and more the pure
and direct emotion that it is.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>In childhood it takes this form. The boys who pull
out grasshoppers' legs and butterflies' wings, and disembowel
every frog they catch, have no <i>thought</i> at all about the
matter. The creatures tempt their hands to a fascinating
occupation, to which they have to yield. It is with them
as with the 'boy-fiend' Jesse Pomeroy, who cut a little
girl's throat, 'just to see how she'd act.' The normal provocatives
of the impulse are all living beasts, great and
small, toward which a contrary habit has not been formed&mdash;all
human beings in whom we perceive a certain <i>intent</i>
towards <i>us</i>, and a large number of human beings who offend
us peremptorily, either by their look, or gait, or by some
circumstance in their lives which we dislike. Inhibited by
sympathy, and by reflection calling up impulses of an opposite
kind, civilized men lose the habit of acting out their
pugnacious instincts in a perfectly natural way, and a passing
feeling of anger, with its comparatively faint bodily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
expressions, may be the limit of their physical combativeness.
Such a feeling as this may, however, be aroused by a wide
range of objects. Inanimate things, combinations of color
and sound, bad bills of fare, may in persons who combine
fastidious taste with an irascible temperament produce
real ebullitions of rage. Though the female sex is often
said to have less pugnacity than the male, the difference
seems connected more with the extent of the motor consequences
of the impulse than with its frequency. Women
take offence and get angry, if anything, more easily than men,
but their anger is inhibited by fear and other principles of
their nature from expressing itself in blows. The hunting-instinct
proper seems to be decidedly weaker in them than
in men. The latter instinct is easily restricted by habit to
certain objects, which become legitimate 'game,' while
other things are spared. If the hunting-instinct be not exercised
at all, it may even entirely die out, and a man may
enjoy letting a wild creature live, even though he might easily
kill it. Such a type is now becoming frequent; but there
is no doubt that in the eyes of a child of nature such a
personage would seem a sort of moral monster.</p>

<p><i>Fear</i> is a reaction aroused by the same objects that
arouse ferocity. The antagonism of the two is an interesting
study in instinctive dynamics. We both fear, and wish
to kill, anything that may kill us; and the question which
of the two impulses we shall follow is usually decided by
some one of those <i>collateral circumstances</i> of the particular
case, to be moved by which is the mark of superior mental
natures. Of course this introduces uncertainty into the
reaction; but it is an uncertainty found in the higher
brutes as well as in men, and ought not to be taken as
proof that we are less instinctive than they. Fear has
bodily expressions of an extremely energetic kind, and
stands, beside lust and anger, as one of the three most exciting
emotions of which our nature is susceptible. The
progress from brute to man is characterized by nothing so
much as by the decrease in frequency of proper occasions
for fear. In civilized life, in particular, it has at last become
possible for large numbers of people to pass from the
cradle to the grave without ever having had a pang of genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
fear. Many of us need an attack of mental disease to
teach us the meaning of the word. Hence the possibility
of so much blindly optimistic philosophy and religion.
The atrocities of life become 'like a tale of little meaning
though the words are strong;' we doubt if anything like <i>us</i>
ever really was within the tiger's jaws, and conclude that
the horrors we hear of are but a sort of painted tapestry
for the chambers in which we lie so comfortably at peace
with ourselves and with the world.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, fear is a genuine instinct, and one of
the earliest shown by the human child. <i>Noises</i> seem especially
to call it forth. Most noises from the outer world,
to a child bred in the house, have no exact significance.
They are simply startling. To quote a good observer, M.
Perez:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Children between three and ten months are less often alarmed by
visual than by auditory impressions. In cats, from the fifteenth day,
the contrary is the case. A child, three and a half months old, in the
midst of the turmoil of a conflagration, in presence of the devouring
flames and ruined walls, showed neither astonishment nor fear, but
smiled at the woman who was taking care of him, while his parents
were busy. The noise, however, of the trumpet of the firemen, who
were approaching, and that of the wheels of the engine, made him
start and cry. At this age I have never yet seen an infant startled at a
flash of lightning, even when intense; but I have seen many of them
alarmed at the voice of the thunder.... Thus fear comes rather by
the ears than by the eyes, to the child without experience. It is natural
that this should be reversed, or reduced, in animals organized to
perceive danger afar. Accordingly, although I have never seen a child
frightened at his first sight of fire, I have many a time seen young dogs,
young cats, young chickens, and young birds frightened thereby.... I
picked up some years ago a lost cat about a year old. Some months
afterward at the onset of cold weather I lit the fire in the grate of my
study, which was her reception-room. She first looked at the flame in
a very frightened way. I brought her near to it. She leaped away
and ran to hide under the bed. Although the fire was lighted every day,
it was not until the end of the winter that I could prevail upon her to
stay upon a chair near it. The next winter, however, all apprehension
had disappeared.... Let us, then, conclude that there are hereditary
dispositions to fear, which are independent of experience, but which
experiences may end by attenuating very considerably. In the human
infant I believe them to be particularly connected with the ear."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>
<p>The effect of noise in heightening any terror we may
feel in adult years is very marked. The <i>howling</i> of the
storm, whether on sea or land, is a principal cause of our
anxiety when exposed to it. The writer has been interested
in noticing in his own person, while lying in bed, and kept
awake by the wind outside, how invariably each loud gust
of it arrested momentarily his heart. A dog, attacking us,
is much more dreadful by reason of the noises he makes.</p>

<p><i>Strange men</i>, and <i>strange animals</i>, either large or small,
excite fear, but especially men or animals advancing toward
us in a threatening way. This is entirely instinctive and
antecedent to experience. Some children will cry with
terror at their very first sight of a cat or dog, and it will
often be impossible for weeks to make them touch it.
Others will wish to fondle it almost immediately. Certain
kinds of 'vermin,' especially spiders and snakes, seem to
excite a fear unusually difficult to overcome. It is impossible
to say how much of this difference is instinctive and
how much the result of stories heard about these creatures.
That the fear of 'vermin' ripens gradually, seemed to me
to be proved in a child of my own to whom I gave a live
frog once, at the age of six to eight months, and again when
he was a year and a half old. The first time he seized it
promptly, and holding it, in spite of its struggling, at last
got its head into his mouth. He then let it crawl up his
breast, and get upon his face, without showing alarm. But
the second time, although he had seen no frog and heard
no story about a frog between whiles, it was almost impossible
to induce him to touch it. Another child, a year old,
eagerly took some very large spiders into his hand. At
present he is afraid, but has been exposed meanwhile to
the teachings of the nursery. One of my children from her
birth upwards saw daily the pet pug-dog of the house, and
never betrayed the slightest fear until she was (if I recollect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
rightly) about eight months old. Then the instinct
suddenly seemed to develop, and with such intensity that
familiarity had no mitigating effect. She screamed whenever
the dog entered the room, and for many months remained
afraid to touch him. It is needless to say that no
change in the pug's unfailingly friendly conduct had anything
to do with this change of feeling in the child.</p>

<p>Preyer tells of a young child screaming with fear on
being carried near to the <i>sea</i>. The great source of terror
to infancy is solitude. The teleology of this is obvious, as
is also that of the infant's expression of dismay&mdash;the never-failing
cry&mdash;on waking up and finding himself alone.</p>

<p><i>Black things</i>, and especially <i>dark places</i>, holes, caverns,
etc., arouse a peculiarly gruesome fear. This fear, as well
as that of solitude, of being 'lost,' are explained after a
fashion by ancestral experience. Says Schneider:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is a fact that men, especially in childhood, fear to go into a dark
cavern or a gloomy wood. This feeling of fear arises, to be sure,
partly from the fact that we easily suspect that dangerous beasts may
lurk in these localities&mdash;a suspicion due to stories we have heard and
read. But, on the other hand, it is quite sure that this fear at a certain
perception is also directly inherited. Children who have been carefully
guarded from all ghost-stories are nevertheless terrified and cry if led
into a dark place, especially if sounds are made there. Even an adult
can easily observe that an uncomfortable timidity steals over him in a
lonely wood at night, although he may have the fixed conviction that
not the slightest danger is near.</p>

<p>"This feeling of fear occurs in many men even in their own house
after dark, although it is much stronger in a dark cavern or forest. The
fact of such instinctive fear is easily explicable when we consider that
our savage ancestors through innumerable generations were accustomed
to meet with dangerous beasts in caverns, especially bears, and were
for the most part attacked by such beasts during the night and in the
woods, and that thus an inseparable association between the perceptions
of darkness of caverns and woods, and fear took place, and was
inherited."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>High places</i> cause fear of a peculiarly sickening sort,
though here, again, individuals differ enormously. The
utterly blind instinctive character of the motor impulses
here is shown by the fact that they are almost always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
entirely unreasonable, but that reason is powerless to
suppress them. That they are a mere incidental peculiarity
of the nervous system, like liability to sea-sickness, or love
of music, with no teleological significance, seems more than
probable. The fear in question varies so much from one person
to another, and its detrimental effects are so much more
obvious than its uses, that it is hard to see how it could be
a selected instinct. Man is anatomically one of the best
fitted of animals for climbing about high places. The best
psychical complement to this equipment would seem to be
a 'level head' when there, not a dread of going there at
all. In fact, the teleology of fear, beyond a certain
point, is very dubious. Professor Mosso, in his interesting
monograph, 'La Paura' (which has been translated into
French), concludes that many of its manifestations must be
considered pathological rather than useful; Bain, in several
places, expresses the same opinion; and this, I think, is
surely the view which any observer without <i>a priori</i> prejudices
must take. A certain amount of timidity obviously
adapts us to the world we live in, but the <i>fear-paroxysm</i> is
surely altogether harmful to him who is its prey.</p>

<p>Fear of the supernatural is one variety of fear. It is
difficult to assign any normal object for this fear, unless it
were a genuine ghost. But, in spite of psychical research-societies,
science has not yet adopted ghosts; so we can only
say that certain <i>ideas</i> of supernatural agency, associated
with real circumstances, produce a peculiar kind of horror.
This horror is probably explicable as the result of a combination
of simpler horrors. To bring the ghostly terror to its
maximum, many usual elements of the dreadful must combine,
such as loneliness, darkness, inexplicable sounds, especially
of a dismal character, moving figures half discerned
(or, if discerned, of dreadful aspect), and a vertiginous baffling
of the expectation. This last element, which is <i>intellectual</i>,
is very important. It produces a strange emotional
'curdle' in our blood to see a process with which we are
familiar deliberately taking an unwonted course. Any
one's heart would stop beating if he perceived his chair
sliding unassisted across the floor. The lower animals
appear to be sensitive to the mysteriously exceptional as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
well as ourselves. My friend Professor W. K. Brooks, of
the Johns Hopkins University, told me of his large and
noble dog being frightened into a sort of epileptic fit by a
bone being drawn across the floor by a thread which the
dog did not see. Darwin and Romanes have given similar
experiences.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The idea of the supernatural involves that
the usual should be set at naught. In the witch and hobgoblin
supernatural, other elements still of fear are brought
in&mdash;caverns, slime and ooze, vermin, corpses, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
A human corpse seems normally to produce an instinctive
dread, which is no doubt somewhat due to its mysteriousness,
and which familiarity rapidly dispels. But, in view of the
fact that cadaveric, reptilian, and underground horrors play
so specific and constant a part in many nightmares and
forms of delirium, it seems not altogether unwise to ask
whether these forms of dreadful circumstance may not at a
former period have been more normal objects of the environment
than now. The ordinary cock-sure evolutionist
ought to have no difficulty in explaining these terrors, and
the scenery that provokes them, as relapses into the
consciousness of the cave-men, a consciousness usually
overlaid in us by experiences of more recent date.</p>

<p>There are certain other pathological fears, and certain
peculiarities in the expression of ordinary fear, which
might receive an explanatory light from ancestral conditions,
even infra-human ones. In ordinary fear, one may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
either run, or remain semi-paralyzed. The latter condition
reminds us of the so-called death-shamming instinct shown
by many animals. Dr. Lindsay, in his work 'Mind in
Animals,' says this must require great self-command in
those that practise it. But it is really no feigning of death
at all, and requires no self-command. It is simply a terror-paralysis
which has been so useful as to become hereditary.
The beast of prey does not think the motionless bird, insect,
or crustacean dead. He simply fails to notice them at all;
because his senses, like ours, are much more strongly
excited by a moving object than by a still one. It is the
same instinct which leads a boy playing 'I spy' to hold
his very breath when the seeker is near, and which makes
the beast of prey himself in many cases motionlessly lie in
wait for his victim or silently 'stalk' it, by rapid approaches
alternated with periods of immobility. It is the
opposite of the instinct which makes us jump up and down
and move our arms when we wish to attract the notice of
some one passing far away, and makes the shipwrecked
sailor frantically wave a cloth upon the raft where he is
floating when a distant sail appears. Now, may not the
statue-like, crouching immobility of some melancholiacs,
insane with general anxiety and fear of everything, be in
some way connected with this old instinct? They can give
no <i>reason</i> for their fear to move; but immobility makes them
feel safer and more comfortable. Is not this the mental
state of the 'feigning' animal?</p>

<p>Again, take the strange symptom which has been described
of late years by the rather absurd name of <i>agoraphobia</i>.
The patient is seized with palpitation and terror
at the sight of any open place or broad street which
he has to cross alone. He trembles, his knees bend, he
may even faint at the idea. Where he has sufficient self-command
he sometimes accomplishes the object by keeping
safe under the lee of a vehicle going across, or joining
himself to a knot of other people. But usually he
slinks round the sides of the square, hugging the houses
as closely as he can. This emotion has no utility in a
civilized man, but when we notice the chronic agoraphobia
of our domestic cats, and see the tenacious way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
in which many wild animals, especially rodents, cling to
cover, and only venture on a dash across the open as a
desperate measure&mdash;even then making for every stone or
bunch of weeds which may give a momentary shelter&mdash;when
we see this we are strongly tempted to ask whether such an
odd kind of fear in us be not due to the accidental resurrection,
through disease, of a sort of instinct which may in
some of our ancestors have had a permanent and on the
whole a useful part to play?</p>

<p><i>Appropriation</i> or <i>Acquisitiveness</i>. The beginnings of acquisitiveness
are seen in the impulse which very young
children display, to snatch at, or beg for, any object which
pleases their attention. Later, when they begin to speak,
among the first words they emphasize are 'me' and 'mine.'<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
Their earliest quarrels with each other are about questions
of ownership; and parents of twins soon learn that it conduces
to a quiet house to buy all presents in impartial duplicate.
Of the later evolution of the proprietary instinct I
need not speak. Everyone knows how difficult a thing it is
not to covet whatever pleasing thing we see, and how the
sweetness of the thing often is as gall to us so long as it is
another's. When another is in possession, the impulse to
appropriate the thing often turns into the impulse to harm
him&mdash;what is called <i>envy</i>, or <i>jealousy</i>, ensues. In civilized
life the impulse to own is usually checked by a variety of
considerations, and only passes over into action under circumstances
legitimated by habit and common consent, an
additional example of the way in which one instinctive tendency
may be inhibited by others. A variety of the proprietary
instinct is the impulse to form collections of the same
sort of thing. It differs much in individuals, and shows in
a striking way how instinct and habit interact. For, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
a collection of any given thing&mdash;like postage-stamps&mdash;need
not be begun by any given person, yet the chances
are that if accidentally it <i>be</i> begun by a person with the collecting
instinct, it will probably be continued. The chief
interest of the objects, in the collector's eyes, is that they
are a collection, and that they are his. Rivalry, to be sure,
inflames this, as it does every other passion, yet the objects
of a collector's mania need not be necessarily such as are
generally in demand. Boys will collect anything that they
see another boy collect, from pieces of chalk and peach-pits
up to books and photographs. Out of a hundred students
whom I questioned, only four or five had never collected
anything.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>The associationist psychology denies that there is any
blind primitive instinct to appropriate, and would explain all
acquisitiveness, in the first instance, as a desire to secure the
'pleasures' which the objects possessed may yield; and, secondly,
as the association of the idea of pleasantness with the
<i>holding</i> of the thing, even though the pleasure originally got
by it was only gained through its expense or destruction.
Thus the miser is shown to us as one who has transferred
to the gold by which he may buy the goods of this life all
the emotions which the goods themselves would yield; and
who thereafter loves the gold for its own sake, preferring
the means of pleasure to the pleasure itself. There can be
little doubt that much of this analysis a broader view of
the facts would have dispelled. 'The miser' is an abstraction.
There are all kinds of misers. The common sort,
the excessively niggardly man, simply exhibits the psychological
law that the potential has often a far greater influence
over our mind than the actual. A man will not marry
now, because to do so puts an end to his indefinite potentialities
of choice of a partner. He prefers the latter. He
will not use open fires or wear his good clothes, because the
day may come when he will have to use the furnace or
dress in a worn-out coat, 'and then where will he be?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
For him, better the actual evil than the fear of it; and so
it is with the common lot of misers. Better to live poor
now, with the <i>power</i> of living rich, than to live rich at the
risk of losing the power. These men value their gold, not
for its own sake, but for its powers. Demonetize it, and see
how quickly they will get rid of it! The associationist theory
is, as regards them, entirely at fault: they care nothing
for the gold <i>in se</i>.</p>

<p>With other misers there combines itself with this preference
of the power over the act the far more instinctive
element of the simple collecting propensity. Every one
collects money, and when a man of petty ways is smitten
with the collecting mania for this object he necessarily becomes
a miser. Here again the associationist psychology
is wholly at fault. The hoarding instinct prevails widely
among animals as well as among men. Professor Silliman
has thus described one of the hoards of the California
wood-rat, made in an empty stove of an unoccupied house:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I found the outside to be composed entirely of spikes, all laid
with symmetry, so as to present the points of the nails outward. In the
centre of this mass was the nest, composed of finely-divided fibres of
hemp-packing. Interlaced with the spikes were the following: about
two dozen knives, forks, and spoons; all the butcher's knives, three
in number; a large carving-knife, fork, and steel; several large plugs
of tobacco,... an old purse containing some silver, matches, and
tobacco; nearly all the small tools from the tool-closets, with several
large augers,... all of which must have been transported some distance,
as they were originally stored in different parts of the house....
The outside casing of a silver watch was disposed of in one part of
the pile, the glass of the same watch in another, and the works
in still another."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In every lunatic asylum we find the collecting instinct
developing itself in an equally absurd way. Certain patients
will spend all their time picking pins from the
floor and hoarding them. Others collect bits of thread,
buttons, or rags, and prize them exceedingly. Now, 'the
Miser' <i>par excellence</i> of the popular imagination and of
melodrama, the monster of squalor and misanthropy, is
simply one of these mentally deranged persons. His intellect
may in many matters be clear, but his instincts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
especially that of ownership, are insane, and their insanity
has no more to do with the association of ideas than with
the precession of the equinoxes. As a matter of fact his
hoarding usually is directed to money; but it also includes
almost anything besides. Lately in a Massachusetts town
there died a miser who principally hoarded newspapers.
These had ended by so filling all the rooms of his good-sized
house from floor to ceiling that his living-space was
restricted to a few narrow channels between them. Even
as I write, the morning paper gives an account of the
emptying of a miser's den in Boston by the City Board of
Health. What the owner hoarded is thus described:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He gathered old newspapers, wrapping-paper, incapacitated umbrellas,
canes, pieces of common wire, cast-off clothing, empty barrels,
pieces of iron, old bones, battered tin-ware, fractured pots, and bushels
of such miscellany as is to be found only at the city 'dump.' The
empty barrels were filled, shelves were filled, every hole and corner was
filled, and in order to make more storage-room, 'the hermit' covered
his store-room with a network of ropes, and hung the ropes as full as
they could hold of his curious collections. There was nothing one could
think of that wasn't in that room. As a wood-sawyer, the old man had
never thrown away a saw-blade or a wood-buck. The bucks were rheumatic
and couldn't stand up, and the saw-blades were worn down to
almost nothing in the middle. Some had been actually worn in two,
but the ends were carefully saved and stored away. As a coal-heaver,
the old man had never cast off a worn-out basket, and there were
dozens of the remains of the old things, patched up with canvas and
rope-yarns, in the store-room. There were at least two dozen old hats,
fur, cloth, silk, and straw," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course there may be a great many 'associations of
ideas' in the miser's mind about the things he hoards. He
is a thinking being, and must associate things; but, without
an entirely blind impulse in this direction behind all his
ideas, such practical results could never be reached.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p><i>Kleptomania</i>, as it is called, is an uncontrollable impulse
to appropriate, occurring in persons whose 'associations
of ideas' would naturally all be of a counteracting sort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
Kleptomaniacs often promptly restore, or permit to be restored,
what they have taken; so the impulse need not be
to keep, but only to take. But elsewhere hoarding complicates
the result. A gentleman, with whose case I am
acquainted, was discovered, after his death, to have a hoard
in his barn of all sorts of articles, mainly of a trumpery
sort, but including pieces of silver which he had stolen
from his own dining-room, and utensils which he had stolen
from his own kitchen, and for which he had afterward
bought substitutes with his own money.</p>

<p><i>Constructiveness</i> is as genuine and irresistible an instinct
in man as in the bee or the beaver. Whatever things are
plastic to his hands, those things he must remodel into
shapes of his own, and the result of the remodelling, however
useless it may be, gives him more pleasure than the
original thing. The mania of young children for breaking
and pulling apart whatever is given them is more often
the expression of a rudimentary constructive impulse than
of a destructive one. 'Blocks' are the playthings of
which they are least apt to tire. Clothes, weapons,
tools, habitations, and works of art are the result of the
discoveries to which the plastic instinct leads, each individual
starting where his forerunners left off, and tradition
preserving all that once is gained. Clothing, where not
necessitated by cold, is nothing but a sort of attempt to remodel
the human body itself&mdash;an attempt still better shown
in the various tattooings, tooth-filings, scarrings, and other
mutilations that are practised by savage tribes. As for
habitation, there can be no doubt that the instinct to seek
a sheltered nook, open only on one side, into which he may
retire and be safe, is in man quite as specific as the instinct
of birds to build a nest. It is not necessarily in the
shape of a shelter from wet and cold that the need comes
before him, but he feels less <i>exposed</i> and more at home
when not altogether uninclosed than when lying all abroad.
Of course the utilitarian origin of this instinct is obvious.
But to stick to bare facts at present and not to trace
origins, we must admit that this instinct now exists, and
probably always has existed, since man was man. Habits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
of the most complicated kind are reared upon it. But
even in the midst of these habits we see the blind instinct
cropping out; as, for example, in the fact that we feign a
shelter within a shelter, by backing up beds in rooms with
their heads against the wall, and never lying in them the
other way&mdash;just as dogs prefer to get under or upon some
piece of furniture to sleep, instead of lying in the middle
of the room. The first habitations were caves and leafy
grottoes, bettered by the hands; and we see children to-day,
when playing in wild places, take the greatest delight
in discovering and appropriating such retreats and 'playing
house' there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Play.</i> The impulse to play in special ways is certainly
instinctive. A boy can no more help running after another
boy who runs provokingly near him, than a kitten can help
running after a rolling ball. A child trying to get into its
own hand some object which it sees another child pick up,
and the latter trying to get away with the prize, are just as
much slaves of an automatic prompting as are two chickens
or fishes, of which one has taken a big morsel into its mouth
and decamps with it, while the other darts after in pursuit.
All simple active games are attempts to gain the excitement
yielded by certain primitive instincts, through feigning that
the occasions for their exercise are there. They involve
imitation, hunting, fighting, rivalry, acquisitiveness, and
construction, combined in various ways; their special rules
are habits, discovered by accident, selected by intelligence,
and propagated by tradition; but unless they were founded
in automatic impulses, games would lose most of their zest.
The sexes differ somewhat in their play-impulses. As
Schneider says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The little boy imitates soldiers, models clay into an oven, builds
houses, makes a wagon out of chairs, rides on horseback upon a stick,
drives nails with the hammer, harnesses his brethren and comrades
together and plays the stage-driver, or lets himself be captured as a
wild horse by some one else. The girl, on the contrary, plays with her
doll, washes and dresses it, strokes it, clasps and kisses it, puts it to
bed and tucks it in, sings it a cradle-song, or speaks with it as if it
were a living being.... This fact that a sexual difference exists in
the play-impulse, that a boy gets more pleasure from a horse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
rider and a soldier than from a doll, while with the girl the opposite is
the case, is proof that an hereditary connection exists between the
perception of certain things (horse, doll, etc.), and the feeling of pleasure,
as well as between this latter and the impulse to play."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There is another sort of human play, into which higher
æsthetic feelings enter. I refer to that love of festivities,
ceremonies, ordeals, etc., which seems to be universal in our
species. The lowest savages have their dances, more or
less formally conducted. The various religions have their
solemn rites and exercises, and civic and military power
symbolize their grandeur by processions and celebrations
of divers sorts. We have our operas and parties and masquerades.
An element common to all these ceremonial
games, as they may be called, is the excitement of concerted
action as one of an organized crowd. The same
acts, performed with a crowd, seem to mean vastly more
than when performed alone. A walk with the people on
a holiday afternoon, an excursion to drink beer or coffee
at a popular 'resort,' or an ordinary ball-room, are examples
of this. Not only are we amused at seeing so
many strangers, but there is a distinct stimulation at
feeling our share in their collective life. The perception
of them is the stimulus; and our reaction upon it is
our tendency to join them and do what they are doing,
and our unwillingness to be the first to leave off and go
home alone. This seems a primitive element in our nature,
as it is difficult to trace any association of ideas that could
lead up to it; although, once granting it to exist, it is very
easy to see what its uses to a tribe might be in facilitating
prompt and vigorous collective action. The formation of
armies and the undertaking of military expeditions would
be among its fruits. In the ceremonial games it is but the
impulsive starting-point. What particular things the crowd
then shall do, depends for the most part on the initiative of
individuals, fixed by imitation and habit, and continued by
tradition. The co-operation of other æsthetic pleasures
with games, ceremonial or other, has a great deal to do
with the selection of such as shall become stereotyped and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
habitual. The peculiar form of excitement called by Professor
Bain the emotion of <i>pursuit</i>, the pleasure of a <i>crescendo</i>,
is the soul of many common games. The immense
extent of the play-activities in human life is too obvious to
be more than mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Curiosity.</i> Already pretty low down among vertebrates
we find that any object may excite attention, provided it be
only <i>novel</i>, and that attention may be followed by approach
and exploration by nostril, lips, or touch. Curiosity and
fear form a couple of antagonistic emotions liable to be
awakened by the same outward thing, and manifestly both
useful to their possessor. The spectacle of their alternation
is often amusing enough, as in the timid approaches and
scared wheelings which sheep or cattle will make in the
presence of some new object they are investigating. I have
seen alligators in the water act in precisely the same way
towards a man seated on the beach in front of them&mdash;gradually
drawing near as long as he kept still, frantically
careering back as soon as he made a movement. Inasmuch
as new objects <i>may</i> always be advantageous, it is better
that an animal should not <i>absolutely</i> fear them. But, inasmuch
as they may also possibly be harmful, it is better
that he should not be quite indifferent to them either, but
on the whole remaining on the <i>qui vive</i>, ascertain as much
about them, and what they may be likely to bring forth, as
he can, before settling down to rest in their presence.
Some such susceptibility for being excited and irritated by
the mere novelty, as such, of any movable feature of the
environment must form the instinctive basis of all human
curiosity; though, of course, the superstructure absorbs
contributions from so many other factors of the emotional
life that the original root may be hard to find. With what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
is called scientific curiosity, and with metaphysical wonder,
the practical instinctive root has probably nothing to do.
The stimuli here are not objects, but ways of conceiving
objects; and the emotions and actions they give rise to are
to be classed, with many other æsthetic manifestations, sensitive
and motor, as <i>incidental</i> features of our mental life.
The philosophic brain responds to an inconsistency or a
gap in its knowledge, just as the musical brain responds to
a discord in what it hears. At certain ages the sensitiveness
to particular gaps and the pleasure of resolving particular
puzzles reach their maximum, and then it is that stores of
scientific knowledge are easiest and most naturally laid in.
But these effects may have had nothing to do with the uses
for which the brain was originally given; and it is probably
only within a few centuries, since religious beliefs and
economic applications of science have played a prominent
part in the conflicts of one race with another, that they may
have helped to 'select' for survival a particular type of
brain. I shall have to consider this matter of incidental
and supernumerary faculties in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVIII">Chapter XXVIII</a>.</p>

<p><i>Sociability and Shyness.</i> As a gregarious animal, man
is excited both by the absence and by the presence of his
kind. To be alone is one of the greatest of evils for him.
Solitary confinement is by many regarded as a mode of
torture too cruel and unnatural for civilized countries to
adopt. To one long pent up on a desert island, the sight
of a human footprint or a human form in the distance
would be the most tumultuously exciting of experiences.
In morbid states of mind, one of the commonest symptoms
is the fear of being alone. This fear may be assuaged by
the presence of a little child, or even of a baby. In a case
of hydrophobia known to the writer, the patient insisted
on keeping his room <i>crowded</i> with neighbors all the while,
so intense was his fear of solitude. In a gregarious animal,
the perception that he is alone excites him to vigorous
activity. Mr. Galton thus describes the behavior of the
South African cattle whom he had such good opportunities
for observing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although the ox has little affection for, or interest in, his fellows,
he cannot endure even a momentary separation from his herd. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
be separated from it by stratagem or force, he exhibits every sign of
mental agony; he strives with all his might to get back again, and when
he succeeds he plunges into its middle to bathe his whole body with the
comfort of closest companionship."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Man is also excited by the presence of his kind. The
<i>bizarre</i> actions of dogs meeting strange dogs are not altogether
without a parallel in our own constitution. We
cannot meet strangers without a certain tension, or talk to
them exactly as to our familiars. This is particularly the
case if the stranger be an important personage. It may then
happen that we not only shrink from meeting his eye, but
actually cannot collect our wits or do ourselves any sort
of justice in his presence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This odd state of mind," says Darwin,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> "is chiefly recognized by
the face reddening, by the eyes being averted or cast down, and by
awkward, nervous movements of the body.... Shyness seems to depend
on sensitiveness to the opinion, whether good or bad, of others,
more especially with respect to external appearance. Strangers neither
know nor care anything about our conduct or character, but they may,
and often do, criticise our appearance.... The consciousness of anything
peculiar, or even new, in the dress, or any slight blemish on the
person, and more especially on the face&mdash;points which are likely to
attract the attention of strangers&mdash;makes the shy intolerably shy.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> On
the other hand, in those cases in which conduct, and not personal appearance,
is concerned, we are much more apt to be shy in the presence
of acquaintances whose judgment we in some degree value than
in that of strangers.... Some persons, however, are so sensitive that
the mere act of speaking to almost any one is sufficient to rouse their
self-consciousness, and a slight blush is the result. Disapprobation ... causes
shyness and blushing much more readily than does approbation....
Persons who are exceedingly shy are rarely shy in the presence of
those with whom they are quite familiar, and of whose good opinion
and sympathy they are quite assured; for instance, a girl in presence
of her mother.... Shyness ... is closely related to fear; yet it is
distinct from fear in the ordinary sense. A shy man dreads the notice
of strangers, but can hardly be said to be afraid of them; he may be as
bold as a hero in battle, and yet have no self-confidence about trifles in
the presence of strangers. Almost every one is extremely nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
when first addressing a public assembly, and most men remain so
through their lives."</p></blockquote>

<p>As Mr. Darwin observes, a real dread of definite consequences
may enter into this 'stage-fright' and complicate
the shyness. Even so our shyness before an important personage
may be complicated by what Professor Bain calls
'servile terror,' based on representation of definite dangers
if we fail to please. But both stage-fright and servile terror
may exist with the most indefinite apprehensions of danger,
and, in fact, when our reason tells us there is no occasion
for alarm. We must, therefore, admit a certain amount of
purely instinctive perturbation and constraint, due to the
consciousness that we have become objects for other people's
eyes. Mr. Darwin goes on to say: "Shyness comes on at
a very early age. In one of my own children, two years and
three months old, I saw a trace of what certainly appeared
to be shyness directed toward myself, after an absence from
home of only a week." Every parent has noticed the same
sort of thing. Considering the despotic powers of rulers in
savage tribes, respect and awe must, from time immemorial,
have been emotions excited by certain individuals; and
stage-fright, servile terror, and shyness, must have had as
copious opportunities for exercise as at the present time.
Whether these impulses could ever have been useful, and
selected for usefulness, is a question which, it would seem,
can only be answered in the negative. Apparently they
are pure hindrances, like fainting at sight of blood or disease,
sea-sickness, a dizzy head on high places, and certain
squeamishnesses of æsthetic taste. They are <i>incidental</i>
emotions, in spite of which we get along. But they seem
to play an important part in the production of two other
propensities, about the instinctive character of which a good
deal of controversy has prevailed. I refer to cleanliness
and modesty, to which we must proceed, but not before we
have said a word about another impulse closely allied to
shyness. I mean&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Secretiveness</i>, which, although often due to intelligent
calculation and the dread of betraying our interests in some
more or less definitely foreseen way, is quite as often a blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
propensity, serving no useful purpose, and is so stubborn
and ineradicable a part of the character as fully to deserve
a place among the instincts. Its natural stimuli are unfamiliar
human beings, especially those whom we respect. Its
reactions are the arrest of whatever we are saying or doing
when such strangers draw nigh, coupled often with the pretense
that we were not saying or doing that thing, but possibly
something different. Often there is added to this a disposition
to mendacity when asked to give an account of ourselves.
With many persons the first impulse, when the door-bell
rings, or a visitor is suddenly announced, is to scuttle out
of the room, so as not to be 'caught.' When a person at
whom we have been looking becomes aware of us, our immediate
impulse may be to look the other way, and pretend
we have not seen him. Many friends have confessed to
me that this is a frequent phenomenon with them in
meeting acquaintances in the street, especially unfamiliar
ones. The bow is a secondary correction of the primary
feint that we do not see the other person. Probably most
readers will recognize in themselves, at least, the <i>start</i>, the
nascent disposition, on many occasions, to act in each and all
of these several ways. That the 'start' is neutralized by
second thought proves it to come from a deeper region
than thought. There is unquestionably a native impulse
in every one to conceal love-affairs, and the acquired impulse
to conceal pecuniary affairs seems in many to be
almost equally strong. It is to be noted that even where
a given habit of concealment is reflective and deliberate,
its motive is far less often definite prudence than a vague
aversion to have one's sanctity invaded and one's personal
concerns fingered and turned over by other people. Thus,
some persons will never leave anything with their name
written on it, where others may pick it up&mdash;even in the
woods, an old envelope must not be thrown on the ground.
Many cut all the leaves of a book of which they may be
reading a single chapter, so that no one shall know which
one they have singled out, and all this with no <i>definite</i> notion
of harm. The impulse to conceal is more apt to be provoked
by superiors than by equals or inferiors. How differently
do boys talk together when their parents are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
by! Servants see more of their masters' characters than
masters of servants'.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Where we conceal from our equals
and familiars, there is probably always a definite element
of prudential prevision involved. <i>Collective</i> secrecy, mystery,
enters into the emotional interest of many games, and
is one of the elements of the importance men attach to
freemasonries of various sorts, being delightful apart from
any end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Cleanliness.</i> Seeing how very filthy savages and exceptional
individuals among civilized people may be, philosophers
have doubted whether any genuine instinct of cleanliness
exists, and whether education and habit be not responsible
for whatever amount of it is found. Were it an
instinct, its stimulus would be dirt, and its characteristic
reaction the shrinking from contact therewith, and the
cleaning of it away after contact had occurred. Now, if
some animals are cleanly, men <i>may</i> be so, and there can be
no doubt that some kinds of matter <i>are</i> natively repugnant,
both to sight, touch, and smell&mdash;excrementitious and putrid
things, blood, pus, entrails, and diseased tissues, for example.
It is true that the shrinking from contact with these
things may be inhibited very easily, as by a medical education;
and it is equally true that the impulse to clean them
away may be inhibited by so slight an obstacle as the thought
of the coldness of the ablution, or the necessity of getting
up to perform it. It is also true than an impulse to cleanliness,
habitually checked, will become obsolete fast enough.
But none of these facts prove the impulse never to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
there.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> It seems to be there in all cases; and then to be
particularly amenable to outside influences, the child having
his own degree of squeamishness about what he shall
touch or eat, and later being either hardened or made more
fastidious still by the habits he is forced to acquire and the
examples among which he lives.</p>

<p>Examples get their hold on him in this way, that a particularly
evil-smelling or catarrhal or lousy comrade is rather
offensive to him, and that he sees the odiousness in another
of an amount of dirt to which he would have no spontaneous
objection if it were on his own skin. That <i>we dislike
in others things which we tolerate in ourselves</i> is a law of our
æsthetic nature about which there can be no doubt. But
as soon as generalization and reflection step in, this judging
of others leads to a new way of regarding ourselves. "Who
taught you politeness? The impolite," is, I believe, a
Chinese proverb. The concept, 'dirty fellow,' which we
have formed, becomes one under which we personally
shrink from being classed; and so we 'wash up,' and set
ourselves right, at moments when our social self-consciousness
is awakened, in a manner toward which no strictly instinctive
native prompting exists. But the standard of
cleanliness attained in this way is not likely to go beyond
the mutual tolerance for one another of the members of the
tribe, and hence may comport a good deal of actual filth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Modesty, Shame.</i> Whether there be an instinctive impulse
to hide certain parts of the body and certain acts is perhaps
even more open to doubt than whether there be an instinct
of cleanliness. Anthropologists have denied it, and in the
utter shamelessness of infancy and of many savage tribes
have seemed to find a good basis for their views. It must,
however, be remembered that infancy proves nothing, and
that, as far as sexual modesty goes, the sexual impulse itself
works directly against it at times of excitement, and with
reference to certain people; and that habits of immodesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
contracted with those people may forever afterwards inhibit
it any impulse to be modest towards <i>them</i>. This would account
for a great deal of actual immodesty, even if an original
modest impulse were there. On the other hand, the
modest impulse, if it do exist, must be admitted to have a
singularly ill-defined sphere of influence, both as regards the
presences that call it forth, and as regards the acts to
which it leads. Ethnology shows it to have very little
backbone of its own, and to follow easily fashion and example.
Still, it is hard to see the ubiquity of <i>some</i> sort of
tribute to shame, however perverted&mdash;as where female
modesty consists in covering the face alone, or immodesty
in appearing before strangers unpainted&mdash;and to believe it
to have no impulsive root whatever. Now, what may the
impulsive root be? I believe that, for one thing, it is shyness,
the feeling of dread that unfamiliar persons, as explained
above, may inspire us withal. Such persons are the original
stimuli to our modesty.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> But the actions of modesty
are quite different from the actions of shyness. They consist
of the restraint of certain bodily functions, and of the
covering of certain parts; and why do such particular
actions necessarily ensue? That there <i>may</i> be in the human
animal, as such, a 'blind' and immediate automatic impulse
to such restraints and coverings in respect-inspiring presences
is a possibility difficult of actual disproof. But it
seems more likely, from the facts, that the actions of
modesty are suggested to us in a roundabout way; and
that, even more than those of cleanliness, they arise from
the application in the second instance to ourselves of judgments
primarily passed upon our mates. It is not easy to
believe that, even among the nakedest savages, an unusual
degree of cynicism and indecency in an individual should
not beget a certain degree of contempt, and cheapen him
in his neighbor's eyes. Human nature is sufficiently homogeneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
for us to be sure that everywhere reserve must inspire
some respect, and that persons who suffer every liberty
are persons whom others disregard. Not to be like such
people, then, would be one of the first resolutions suggested
by social self-consciousness to a child of nature just
emerging from the unreflective state. And the resolution
would probably acquire effective pungency for the first
time when the social self-consciousness was sharpened into
a real fit of shyness by some person being present whom it
was important not to disgust or displease. Public opinion
would of course go on to build its positive precepts upon
this germ; and, through a variety of examples and experiences,
the ritual of modesty would grow, until it reached
the New England pitch of sensitiveness and range, making
us say stomach instead of belly, limb instead of leg, retire
instead of go to bed, and forbidding us to call a female dog
by name.</p>

<p>At bottom this amounts to the admission that, though
in some shape or other a natural and inevitable feature of
human life, modesty need not necessarily be an instinct in
the pure and simple excito-motor sense of the term.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Love.</i> Of all propensities, the sexual impulses bear on
their face the most obvious signs of being instinctive, in
the sense of blind, automatic, and untaught. The teleology
they contain is often at variance with the wishes of the individuals
concerned; and the actions are performed for no
assignable reason but because Nature urges just that way.
Here, if ever, then, we ought to find those characters of
fatality, infallibility, and uniformity, which, we are told,
make of actions done from instinct a class so utterly apart.
But is this so? The facts are just the reverse: the sexual
instinct is particularly liable to be checked and modified
by slight differences in the individual stimulus, by the
inward condition of the agent himself, by habits once acquired,
and by the antagonism of contrary impulses operating
on the mind. One of these is the ordinary shyness
recently described; another is what might be called the
<i>anti-sexual instinct</i>, the instinct of personal isolation, the
actual repulsiveness to us of the idea of intimate contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
with most of the persons we meet, especially those of
our own sex.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Thus it comes about that this strongest
passion of all, so far from being the most 'irresistible,'
may, on the contrary, be the hardest one to give rein to,
and that individuals in whom the inhibiting influences are
potent may pass through life and never find an occasion to
have it gratified. There could be no better proof of the
truth of that proposition with which we began our study
of the instinctive life in man, that irregularity of behavior
may come as well from the possession of too many instincts
as from the lack of any at all.</p>

<p>The instinct of personal isolation, of which we have
spoken, exists more strongly in men with respect to one
another, and more strongly in women with respect to men.
In women it is called coyness, and has to be positively
overcome by a process of wooing before the sexual instinct
inhibits it and takes its place. As Darwin has shown in
his book on the 'Descent of Man and Sexual Selection,' it
has played a vital part in the amelioration of all higher
animal types, and is to a great degree responsible for whatever
degree of chastity the human race may show. It
illustrates strikingly, however, the law of the inhibition of
instincts by habits&mdash;for, once broken through with a given
person, it is not apt to assert itself again; and habitually
broken through, as by prostitutes, with various persons, it
may altogether decay. Habit also fixes it in us toward
certain individuals: nothing is so particularly displeasing
as the notion of close personal contact with those whom
we have long known in a respectful and distant way.
The fondness of the ancients and of modern Orientals for
forms of unnatural vice, of which the notion affects us with
horror, is probably a mere case of the way in which this
instinct may be inhibited by habit. We can hardly suppose
that the ancients had by gift of Nature a propensity
of which we are devoid, and were all victims of what is
now a pathological aberration limited to individuals. It is
more probable that with them the instinct of physical aversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
toward a certain class of objects was inhibited early in
life by <i>habits</i>, formed under the influence of <i>example</i>; and that
then a kind of sexual appetite, of which very likely most
men possess the germinal possibility, developed itself in an
unrestricted way. That the development of it in an abnormal
way may check its development in the normal way, seems
to be a well-ascertained medical fact. And that the direction
of the sexual instinct towards one individual tends to
inhibit its application to other individuals, is a law, upon
which, though it suffers many exceptions, the whole <i>régime</i>
of monogamy is based. These details are a little unpleasant
to discuss, but they show so beautifully the correctness
of the general principles in the light of which our review
has been made, that it was impossible to pass them over
unremarked.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Jealousy</i> is unquestionably instinctive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Parental Love</i> is an instinct stronger in woman than in
man, at least in the early childhood of its object. I need
do little more than quote Schneider's lively description of
it as it exists in her:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As soon as a wife becomes a mother her whole thought and feeling,
her whole being, is altered. Until then she had only thought of
her own well-being, of the satisfaction of her vanity; the whole world
appeared made only for her; everything that went on about her was
only noticed so far as it had personal reference to herself; she asked
of every one that he should appear interested in her, pay her the requisite
attention, and as far as possible fulfil her wishes. Now, however,
the centre of the world is no longer herself, but her child. She
does not think of her own hunger, she must first be sure that the child
is fed. It is nothing to her that she herself is tired and needs rest, so
long as she sees that the child's sleep is disturbed; the moment it stirs
she awakes, though far stronger noises fail to arouse her now. She,
who formerly could not bear the slightest carelessness of dress, and
touched everything with gloves, allows herself to be soiled by the infant,
and does not shrink from seizing its clouts with her naked hands.
Now, she has the greatest patience with the ugly, piping cry-baby
(<i>Schreihals</i>), whereas until now every discordant sound, every slightly
unpleasant noise, made her nervous. Every limb of the still hideous
little being appears to her beautiful, every movement fills her with delight.
She has, in one word, transferred her entire egoism to the child,
and lives only in it. Thus, at least, it is in all unspoiled, naturally-bred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
mothers, who, alas! seem to be growing rarer; and thus it is with all
the higher animal-mothers. The maternal joys of a cat, for example,
are not to be disguised. With an expression of infinite comfort she
stretches out her fore-legs to offer her teats to her children, and moves
her tail with delight when the little hungry mouths tug and suck....
But not only the contact, the bare look of the offspring affords endless
delight, not only because the mother thinks that the child will some
day grow great and handsome and bring her many joys, but because
she has received from Nature an instinctive love for her children. She
does not herself know why she is so happy, and why the look of the
child and the care of it are so agreeable, any more than the young man
can give an account of why he loves a maiden, and is so happy when
she is near. Few mothers, in caring for their child, think of the proper
purpose of maternal love for the preservation of the species. Such a
thought may arise in the father's mind; seldom in that of the mother.
The latter feels only... that it is an everlasting delight to hold the
being which she has brought forth protectingly in her arms, to dress it,
to wash it, to rock it to sleep, or to still its hunger."</p></blockquote>

<p>So far the worthy Schneider, to whose words may be
added this remark, that the passionate devotion of a mother&mdash;ill
herself, perhaps&mdash;to a sick or dying child is perhaps
the most simply beautiful moral spectacle that human life
affords. Contemning every danger, triumphing over every
difficulty, outlasting all fatigue, woman's love is here invincibly
superior to anything that man can show.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These are the most prominent of the tendencies which
are worthy of being called instinctive in the human species.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
It will be observed that <i>no other mammal, not even the
monkey, shows so large an array.</i> In a perfectly-rounded
development, every one of these instincts would start a
habit toward certain objects and inhibit a habit toward certain
others. Usually this is the case; but, in the one-sided
development of civilized life, it happens that the
timely age goes by in a sort of starvation of objects, and
the individual then grows up with gaps in his psychic constitution
which future experiences can never fill. Compare
the accomplished gentleman with the poor artisan or tradesman
of a city: during the adolescence of the former,
objects appropriate to his growing interests, bodily and
mental, were offered as fast as the interests awoke, and, as
a consequence, he is armed and equipped at every angle to
meet the world. Sport came to the rescue and completed
his education where real things were lacking. He has
tasted of the essence of every side of human life, being
sailor, hunter, athlete, scholar, fighter, talker, dandy, man
of affairs, etc., all in one. Over the city poor boy's youth
no such golden opportunities were hung, and in his manhood
no desires for most of them exist. Fortunate it is for
him if gaps are the only anomalies his instinctive life presents;
perversions are too often the fruit of his unnatural
bringing up.</p>

are brought up naturally, especially in the country. Everyone knows
what pleasure a boy takes in the sight of a butterfly, fish, crab or other
animal, or of a bird's nest, and what a strong propensity he has for pulling
apart, breaking, opening, and destroying all complex objects, how he delights
in pulling out the wings and legs of flies, and tormenting one animal
or another, how greedy he is to steal secret dainties, with what irresistible
strength the plundering of birds' nests attracts him without his having the
least intention of eating the eggs or the young birds. This fact has long
been familiar, and is daily remarked by teachers; but an explanation of
these impulses which follow upon a mere perception of the objects, without
in most cases any representation being aroused of a future pleasure to
be gained, has as yet been given by no one, and yet the impulses are very
easy to explain. In many cases it will be said that the boy pulls things
apart from curiosity. Quite correct: but whence comes this curiosity, this
irresistible desire to open everything and see what is inside? What makes
the boy take the eggs from the nest and destroy them when he never thinks
of eating them? These are effects of an hereditary instinct, so strong that
warnings and punishments are unable to counteract it." (Schneider: Der

that the very special object blood should have become the stimulus
for a very special interest and excitement. That the sight of it should
make people faint is strange. Less so that a child who sees his blood flow
should forthwith become much more frightened than by the mere feeling
of the cut. Horned cattle often, though not always, become furiously
excited at the smell of blood. In some abnormal human beings the sight
or thought of it exerts a baleful fascination. "B and his father were at a
neighbor's one evening, and, while paring apples, the old man accidentally
cut his hand so severely as to cause the blood to flow profusely. B was
observed to become restless, nervous, pale, and to have undergone a peculiar
change in demeanor. Taking advantage of the distraction produced by
the accident, B escaped from the house and proceeded to a neighboring
farm-yard, where he cut the throat of a horse, killing it." Dr. D. H. Tuke,
commenting on this man's case (Journal of Mental Science, October,
1885), speaks of the influence of blood upon him&mdash;his whole life had been
one chain of cowardly atrocities&mdash;and continues: "There can be no doubt
that with some individuals it constitutes a fascination.... We might
speak of a <i>mania sanguinis</i>. Dr. Savage admitted a man from France into
Bethlehem Hospital some time ago, one of whose earliest symptoms of insanity
was the thirst for blood, which he endeavored to satisfy by going to
an abattoir in Paris. The man whose case I have brought forward had the
same passion for gloating over blood, but had no attack of acute mania.
The sight of blood was distinctly a delight to him, and at any time blood
aroused in him the worst elements of his nature. Instances will easily be
recalled in which murderers, undoubtedly insane, have described the intense
pleasure they experienced in the warm blood of children."</p></div>

the boundaries of instinct fading into reflex action below, and into acquired
habit or suggested activity above, it is likely that there will always
be controversy about just what to include under the class-name. Shall we
add the propensity to walk along a curbstone, or any other narrow path, to
the list of instincts? Shall we subtract secretiveness, as due to shyness or
to fear? Who knows? Meanwhile our physiological method has this inestimable
advantage, that such questions of limit have neither theoretical
nor practical importance. The facts once noted, it matters little how they
are named. Most authors give a shorter list than that in the text. The
phrenologists add adhesiveness, inhabitiveness, love of approbation, etc.,
etc., to their list of 'sentiments,' which in the main agree with our list of
instincts. Fortlage, in his System der Psychologie, classes among the
<i>Triebe</i> all the vegetative physiological functions. Santlus (Zur Psychologie
der Menschlichen Triebe, Leipsic, 1864) says there are at bottom but three
instincts, that of 'Being,' that of 'Function,' and that of 'Life.' The
'Instinct of Being' he subdivides into <i>animal</i>, embracing the activities of
all the senses; and <i>psychical</i>, embracing the acts of the intellect and of
the 'transempiric consciousness.' The 'Instinct of Function' he divides
into <i>sexual, inclinational</i> (friendship, attachment, honor); and <i>moral</i> (religion,
philanthropy, faith, truth, moral freedom, etc.). The 'Instinct of
Life' embraces <i>conservation</i> (nutrition, motion); <i>sociability</i> (imitation,
juridical and ethical arrangements); and <i>personal interest</i> (love of independence
and freedom, acquisitiveness, self-defence). Such a muddled
list as this shows how great are the advantages of the physiological analysis
we have used.</p></div>

<h4>THE EMOTIONS.</h4>


<p>In speaking of the instincts it has been impossible to
keep them separate from the emotional excitements which
go with them. Objects of rage, love, fear, etc., not only
prompt a man to outward deeds, but provoke characteristic
alterations in his attitude and visage, and affect his breathing,
circulation, and other organic functions in specific ways.
When the outward deeds are inhibited, these latter emotional
expressions still remain, and we read the anger in the face,
though the blow may not be struck, and the fear betrays
itself in voice and color, though one may suppress all other
sign. <i>Instinctive reactions and emotional expressions thus
shade imperceptibly into each other. Every object that excites
an instinct excites an emotion as well.</i> Emotions, however,
fall short of instincts, in that the emotional reaction usually
terminates in the subject's own body, whilst the instinctive
reaction is apt to go farther and enter into practical relations
with the exciting object.</p>

<p>Emotional reactions are often excited by objects with
which we have no practical dealings. A ludicrous object,
for example, or a beautiful object are not necessarily objects
to which we <i>do</i> anything; we simply laugh, or stand
in admiration, as the case may be. The class of emotional,
is thus rather larger than that of instinctive, impulses,
commonly so called. Its stimuli are more numerous, and
its expressions are more internal and delicate, and often
less practical. The physiological plan and essence of the
two classes of impulse, however, is the same.</p>

<p>As with instincts, so with emotions, the mere memory or
imagination of the object may suffice to liberate the excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
One may get angrier in thinking over one's insult
than at the moment of receiving it; and we melt more over
a mother who is dead than we ever did when she was living.
In the rest of the chapter I shall use the word <i>object</i> of
emotion indifferently to mean one which is physically
present or one which is merely thought of.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to go through a complete list of the
reactions which characterize the various emotions. For
that the special treatises must be referred to. A few examples
of their variety, however, ought to find a place
here. Let me begin with the manifestations of Grief as
a Danish physiologist, C. Lange, describes them:<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The chief feature in the physiognomy of grief is perhaps its paralyzing
effect on the voluntary movements. This effect is by no means
as extreme as that which fright produces, being seldom more than that
degree of weakening which makes it cost an effort to perform actions
usually done with ease. It is, in other words, a feeling of weariness;
and (as in all weariness) movements are made slowly, heavily, without
strength, unwillingly, and with exertion, and are limited to the fewest
possible. By this the grieving person gets his outward stamp: he walks
slowly, unsteadily, dragging his feet and hanging his arms. His voice is
weak and without resonance, in consequence of the feeble activity of the
muscles of expiration and of the larynx. He prefers to sit still, sunk in
himself and silent. The tonicity or 'latent innervation' of the muscles
is strikingly diminished. The neck is bent, the head hangs ('bowed
down' with grief), the relaxation of the cheek- and jaw-muscles makes
the face look long and narrow, the jaw may even hang open. The eyes
appear large, as is always the case where the <i>orbicularis</i> muscle is paralyzed,
but they may often be partly covered by the upper lid which
droops in consequence of the laming of its own <i>levator</i>. With this
condition of weakness of the voluntary nerve- and muscle-apparatus
of the whole body, there coexists, as aforesaid, just as in all states of
similar motor weakness, a subjective feeling of weariness and heaviness,
of something which weighs upon one; one feels 'downcast,'
'oppressed,' 'laden,' one speaks of his 'weight of sorrow,' one must
'bear up' under it, just as one must 'keep down' his anger. Many
there are who 'succumb' to sorrow to such a degree that they literally
cannot stand upright, but sink or lean against surrounding objects, fall
on their knees, or, like Romeo in the monk's cell, throw themselves
upon the earth in their despair.</p>

<p>"But this weakness of the entire voluntary motor apparatus (the
so-called apparatus of 'animal' life) is only one side of the physiology
of grief. Another side, hardly less important, and in its consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
perhaps even more so, belongs to another subdivision of the motor apparatus,
namely, the involuntary or 'organic' muscles, especially those
which are found in the walls of the blood-vessels, and the use of which
is, by contracting, to diminish the latter's calibre. These muscles and
their nerves, forming together the 'vaso-motor apparatus,' act in grief
contrarily to the voluntary motor apparatus. Instead of being paralyzed,
like the latter, the vascular muscles are more strongly contracted than
usual, so that the tissues and organs of the body become anæmic. The
immediate consequence of this bloodlessness is pallor and shrunkenness,
and the pale color and collapsed features are the peculiarities
which, in connection with the relaxation of the visage, give to the victim
of grief his characteristic physiognomy, and often give an impression
of emaciation which ensues too rapidly to be possibly due to real disturbance
of nutrition, or waste uncompensated by repair. Another
regular consequence of the bloodlessness of the skin is a feeling of cold,
and shivering. A constant symptom of grief is sensitiveness to cold,
and difficulty in keeping warm. In grief, the inner organs are unquestionably
anæmic as well as the skin. This is of course not obvious to
the eye, but many phenomena prove it. Such is the diminution of the
various secretions, at least of such as are accessible to observation.
The mouth grows dry, the tongue sticky, and a bitter taste ensues
which, it would appear, is only a consequence of the tongue's dryness.
[The expression 'bitter sorrow' may possibly arise from this.] In
nursing women the milk diminishes or altogether dries up. There is
one of the most regular manifestations of grief, which apparently contradicts
these other physiological phenomena, and that is the weeping,
with its profuse secretion of tears, its swollen reddened face, red eyes,
and augmented secretion from the nasal mucous membrane."</p></blockquote>

<p>Lange goes on to suggest that this may be a reaction
from a previously contracted vaso-motor state. The explanation
seems a forced one. The fact is that there are
changeable expressions of grief. The weeping is as apt as
not to be immediate, especially in women and children.
Some men can never weep. The tearful and the dry phases
alternate in all who can weep, sobbing storms being followed
by periods of calm; and the shrunken, cold, and
pale condition which Lange describes so well is more characteristic
of a severe settled sorrow than of an acute mental
pain. Properly we have two distinct emotions here, both
prompted by the same object, it is true, but affecting different
persons, or the same person at different times, and
<i>feeling</i> quite differently whilst they last, as anyone's consciousness
will testify. There is an excitement during the
crying fit which is not without a certain pungent pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
of its own; but it would take a genius for felicity to discover
any dash of redeeming quality in the feeling of dry
and shrunken sorrow.&mdash;Our author continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the smaller vessels of the lungs contract so that these organs
become anæmic, we have (as is usual under such conditions) the feeling
of insufficient breath, and of oppression of the chest, and these tormenting
sensations increase the sufferings of the griever, who seeks
relief by long-drawn sighs, instinctively, like every one who lacks
breath from whatever cause.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span></p>
<p>"The anæmia of the brain in grief is shown by intellectual inertia,
dullness, a feeling of mental weariness, effort, and indisposition to
work, often by sleeplessness. Indeed it is the anæmia of the motor
centres of the brain which lies at the bottom of all that weakening of
the voluntary powers of motion which we described in the first instance."</p></blockquote>

<p>My impression is that Dr. Lange simplifies and universalizes
the phenomena a little too much in this description,
and in particular that he very likely overdoes the anæmia-business.
But such as it is, his account may stand as a
favorable specimen of the sort of descriptive work to which
the emotions have given rise.</p>

<p>Take next another emotion, Fear, and read what Mr. Darwin
says of its effects:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Fear is often preceded by astonishment, and is so far akin to it
that both lead to the senses of sight and hearing being instantly aroused.
In both cases the eyes and mouth are widely opened and the eyebrows
raised. The frightened man at first stands like a statue, motionless and
breathless, or crouches down as if instinctively to escape observation.
The heart beats quickly and violently, so that it palpitates or knocks
against the ribs; but it is very doubtful if it then works more efficiently
than usual, so as to send a greater supply of blood to all parts of the
body; for the skin instantly becomes pale as during incipient faintness.
This paleness of the surface, however, is probably in large part, or is exclusively,
due to the vaso-motor centre being affected in such a manner
as to cause the contraction of the small arteries of the skin. That the
skin is much affected under the sense of great fear, we see in the marvellous
manner in which perspiration immediately exudes from it. This
exudation is all the more remarkable, as the surface is then cold, and
hence the term, a cold sweat; whereas the sudorific glands are properly
excited into action when the surface is heated. The hairs also on the
skin stand erect, and the superficial muscles shiver. In connection with
the disturbed action of the heart the breathing is hurried. The salivary
glands act imperfectly; the mouth becomes dry and is often opened and
shut. I have also noticed that under slight fear there is strong tendency to
yawn. One of the best marked symptoms is the trembling of all the muscles
of the body; and this is often first seen in the lips. From this cause,
and from the dryness of the mouth, the voice becomes husky or indistinct
or may altogether fail. 'Obstupui steteruntque comæ, et vox faucibus
hæsit.'... As fear increases into an agony of terror, we behold,
as under all violent emotions, diversified results. The heart beats wildly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
or must fail to act and faintness ensue; there is a death-like pallor;
the breathing is labored; the wings of the nostrils are widely dilated;
there is a gasping and convulsive motion of the lips, a tremor on the
hollow cheek, a gulping and catching of the throat; the uncovered and
protruding eyeballs are fixed on the object of terror; or they may roll
restlessly from side to side, <i>huc illuc volens oculos totumque pererrat</i>.
The pupils are said to be enormously dilated. All the muscles of the
body may become rigid or may be thrown into convulsive movements.
The hands are alternately clenched and opened, often with a twitching
movement. The arms may be protruded as if to avert some dreadful
danger, or may be thrown wildly over the head. The Rev. Mr. Hagenauer
has seen this latter action in a terrified Australian. In other cases
there is a sudden and uncontrollable tendency to headlong flight; and
so strong is this that the boldest soldiers may be seized with a sudden
panic."<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Finally take Hatred, and read the synopsis of its possible
effects as given by Sig. Mantegazza:<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Withdrawal of the head backwards, withdrawal of the trunk;
projection forwards of the hands, as if to defend one's self against the
hated object; contraction or closure of the eyes; elevation of the upper
lip and closure of the nose,&mdash;these are all elementary movements of turning
away. Next threatening movements, as: intense frowning; eyes
wide open; display of teeth; grinding teeth and contracting jaws;
opened mouth with tongue advanced: clenched fists; threatening action
of arms; stamping with the feet; deep inspirations&mdash;panting; growling
and various cries; automatic repetition of one word or syllable; sudden
weakness and trembling of voice; spitting. Finally, various miscellaneous
reactions and vaso-motor symptoms: general trembling; convulsions
of lips and facial muscles, of limbs and of trunk; acts of violence
to one's self, as biting fist or nails; sardonic laughter; bright redness
of face; sudden pallor of face; extreme dilatation of nostrils; standing
up of hair on head."</p></blockquote>

<p>Were we to go through the whole list of emotions which
have been named by men, and study their organic manifestations,
we should but ring the changes on the elements
which these three typical cases involve. Rigidity of this
muscle, relaxation of that, constriction of arteries here, dilatation
there, breathing of this sort or that, pulse slowing
or quickening, this gland secreting and that one dry, etc.,
etc. We should, moreover, find that our descriptions had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
absolute truth; that they only applied to the average man;
that every one of us, almost, has some personal idiosyncrasy
of expression, laughing or sobbing differently from his
neighbor, or reddening or growing pale where others do
not. We should find a like variation in the objects which
excite emotion in different persons. Jokes at which one
explodes with laughter nauseate another, and seem blasphemous
to a third; and occasions which overwhelm me with
fear or bashfulness are just what give you the full sense of
ease and power. The internal shadings of emotional feeling,
moreover, merge endlessly into each other. Language
has discriminated some of them, as hatred, antipathy, animosity,
dislike, aversion, malice, spite, vengefulness, abhorrence,
etc., etc.; but in the dictionaries of synonyms we
find these feelings distinguished more by their severally
appropriate objective stimuli than by their conscious or
subjective tone.</p>

<p>The result of all this flux is that the merely descriptive
literature of the emotions is one of the most tedious parts
of psychology. And not only is it tedious, but you feel
that its subdivisions are to a great extent either fictitious
or unimportant, and that its pretences to accuracy are a
sham. But unfortunately there is little psychological writing
about the emotions which is not merely descriptive.
As emotions are described in novels, they interest us, for
we are made to share them. We have grown acquainted
with the concrete objects and emergencies which call
them forth, and any knowing touch of introspection which
may grace the page meets with a quick and feeling
response. Confessedly literary works of aphoristic philosophy
also flash lights into our emotional life, and give us a
fitful delight. But as far as "scientific psychology" of the
emotions goes, I may have been surfeited by too much
reading of classic works on the subject, but I should as
lief read verbal descriptions of the shapes of the rocks on
a New Hampshire farm as toil through them again. They
give one nowhere a central point of view, or a deductive
or generative principle. They distinguish and refine and
specify <i>in infinitum</i>, without ever getting on to another logical
level. Whereas the beauty of all truly scientific work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
is to get to ever deeper levels. Is there no way out from this
level of individual description in the case of the emotions?
I believe there is a way out, but I fear that few will take it.</p>

<p>The trouble with the emotions in psychology is that
they are regarded too much as absolutely individual things.
So long as they are set down as so many eternal and sacred
psychic entities, like the old immutable species in natural
history, so long all that <i>can</i> be done with them is reverently
to catalogue their separate characters, points, and effects.
But if we regard them as products of more general causes
(as 'species' are now regarded as products of heredity and
variation), the mere distinguishing and cataloguing becomes
of subsidiary importance. Having the goose which lays
the golden eggs, the description of each egg already laid is
a minor matter. Now the general causes of the emotions
are indubitably physiological. Prof. O. Lange, of Copenhagen,
in the pamphlet from which I have already quoted,
published in 1885 a physiological theory of their constitution
and conditioning, which I had already broached the
previous year in an article in Mind. None of the criticisms
which I have heard of it have made me doubt its
essential truth. I will therefore devote the next few pages
to explaining what it is. I shall limit myself in the first
instance to what may be called the <i>coarser</i> emotions, grief,
fear, rage, love, in which every one recognizes a strong
organic reverberation, and afterwards speak of the <i>subtler</i>
emotions, or of those whose organic reverberation is less
obvious and strong.</p>


<h4>EMOTION FOLLOWS UPON THE BODILY EXPRESSION IN
THE COARSER EMOTIONS AT LEAST.</h4>


<p>Our natural way of thinking about these coarser emotions
is that the mental perception of some fact excites the
mental affection called the emotion, and that this latter
state of mind gives rise to the bodily expression. My
theory, on the contrary, is that <i>the bodily changes follow directly
the perception of the exciting fact, and that our feeling of
the same changes as they occur</i> <span class="smcap">is</span> <i>the emotion</i>. Common-sense
says, we lose our fortune, are sorry and weep; we meet a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
bear, are frightened and run; we are insulted by a rival,
are angry and strike. The hypothesis here to be defended
says that this order of sequence is incorrect, that the one
mental state is not immediately induced by the other, that
the bodily manifestations must first be interposed between,
and that the more rational statement is that we feel sorry
because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because
we tremble, and not that we cry, strike, or tremble, because
we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be.
Without the bodily states following on the perception, the
latter would be purely cognitive in form, pale, colorless,
destitute of emotional warmth. We might then see the
bear, and judge it best to run, receive the insult and deem
it right to strike, but we should not actually <i>feel</i> afraid or
angry.</p>

<p>Stated in this crude way, the hypothesis is pretty sure
to meet with immediate disbelief. And yet neither many
nor far-fetched considerations are required to mitigate its
paradoxical character, and possibly to produce conviction
of its truth.</p>

<p>To begin with, no reader of the last two chapters will
be inclined to doubt the fact that <i>objects do excite bodily
changes</i> by a preorganized mechanism, or the farther fact
that <i>the changes are so indefinitely numerous and subtle that the
entire organism may be called a sounding-board</i>, which every
change of consciousness, however slight, may make reverberate.
The various permutations and combinations of
which these organic activities are susceptible make it abstractly
possible that no shade of emotion, however slight,
should be without a bodily reverberation as unique, when
taken in its totality, as is the mental mood itself. The
immense number of parts modified in each emotion is what
makes it so difficult for us to reproduce in cold blood the
total and integral expression of any one of them. We may
catch the trick with the voluntary muscles, but fail with
the skin, glands, heart, and other viscera. Just as an artificially
imitated sneeze lacks something of the reality, so
the attempt to imitate an emotion in the absence of its
normal instigating cause is apt to be rather 'hollow.'</p>

<p>The next thing to be noticed is this, that <i>every one of the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
<i>bodily changes, whatsoever it be, is</i> <span class="smcap">felt,</span> <i>acutely or obscurely, the
moment it occurs.</i> If the reader has never paid attention to
this matter, he will be both interested and astonished to
learn how many different local bodily feelings he can detect
in himself as characteristic of his various emotional moods.
It would be perhaps too much to expect him to arrest the
tide of any strong gust of passion for the sake of any such
curious analysis as this; but he can observe more tranquil
states, and that may be assumed here to be true of the
greater which is shown to be true of the less. Our whole
cubic capacity is sensibly alive; and each morsel of it contributes
its pulsations of feeling, dim or sharp, pleasant,
painful, or dubious, to that sense of personality that every
one of us unfailingly carries with him. It is surprising what
little items give accent to these complexes of sensibility.
When worried by any slight trouble, one may find that the
focus of one's bodily consciousness is the contraction, often
quite inconsiderable, of the eyes and brows. When momentarily
embarrassed, it is something in the pharynx that
compels either a swallow, a clearing of the throat, or a
slight cough; and so on for as many more instances as
might be named. Our concern here being with the general
view rather than with the details, I will not linger to discuss
these, but, assuming the point admitted that every change
that occurs must be felt, I will pass on.</p>

<p>I now proceed to urge the vital point of my whole
theory, which is this: <i>If we fancy some strong emotion, and
then try to abstract from our consciousness of it all the feelings
of its bodily symptoms, we find we have nothing left behind,</i> no
'mind-stuff' out of which the emotion can be constituted,
and that a cold and neutral state of intellectual perception
is all that remains. It is true that, although most people
when asked say that their introspection verifies this statement,
some persist in saying theirs does not. Many cannot
be made to understand the question. When you beg them
to imagine away every feeling of laughter and of tendency
to laugh from their consciousness of the ludicrousness of
an object, and then to tell you what the feeling of its ludicrousness
would be like, whether it be anything more than
the perception that the object belongs to the class 'funny,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
they persist in replying that the thing proposed is a
physical impossibility, and that they always <i>must</i> laugh if
they see a funny object. Of course the task proposed is
not the practical one of seeing a ludicrous object and annihilating
one's tendency to laugh. It is the purely speculative
one of subtracting certain elements of feeling from
an emotional state supposed to exist in its fulness, and saying
what the residual elements are. I cannot help thinking
that all who rightly apprehend this problem will agree
with the proposition above laid down. What kind of an
emotion of fear would be left if the feeling neither of
quickened heart-beats nor of shallow breathing, neither of
trembling lips nor of weakened limbs, neither of goose-flesh
nor of visceral stirrings, were present, it is quite impossible
for me to think. Can one fancy the state of rage and picture
no ebullition in the chest, no flushing of the face, no dilatation
of the nostrils, no clenching of the teeth, no impulse
to vigorous action, but in their stead limp muscles, calm
breathing, and a placid face? The present writer, for one,
certainly cannot. The rage is as completely evaporated as
the sensation of its so-called manifestations, and the only
thing that can possibly be supposed to take its place is some
cold-blooded and dispassionate judicial sentence, confined
entirely to the intellectual realm, to the effect that a certain
person or persons merit chastisement for their sins. In
like manner of grief: what would it be without its tears, its
sobs, its suffocation of the heart, its pang in the breast-bone?
A feelingless cognition that certain circumstances are
deplorable, and nothing more. Every passion in turn tells
the same story. A purely disembodied human emotion is
a nonentity. I do not say that it is a contradiction in the
nature of things, or that pure spirits are necessarily condemned
to cold intellectual lives; but I say that for <i>us</i>,
emotion dissociated from all bodily feeling is inconceivable.
The more closely I scrutinize my states, the more persuaded
I become that whatever moods, affections, and passions I
have are in very truth constituted by, and made up of,
those bodily changes which we ordinarily call their expression
or consequence; and the more it seems to me that if I
were to become corporeally anæsthetic, I should be excluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
from the life of the affections, harsh and tender
alike, and drag out an existence of merely cognitive or intellectual
form. Such an existence, although it seems to
have been the ideal of ancient sages, is too apathetic to be
keenly sought after by those born after the revival of the
worship of sensibility, a few generations ago.</p>

<p>Let not this view be called materialistic. It is neither
more nor less materialistic than any other view which says
that our emotions are conditioned by nervous processes.
No reader of this book is likely to rebel against such a
saying so long as it is expressed in general terms; and
if any one still finds materialism in the thesis now defended,
that must be because of the special processes invoked.
They are <i>sensational</i> processes, processes due to
inward currents set up by physical happenings. Such
processes have, it is true, always been regarded by the
platonizers in psychology as having something peculiarly
base about them. But our emotions must always be <i>inwardly</i>
what they are, whatever be the physiological ground
of their apparition. If they are deep, pure, worthy, spiritual
facts on any conceivable theory of their physiological
source, they remain no less deep, pure, spiritual, and
worthy of regard on this present sensational theory. They
carry their own inner measure of worth with them; and it
is just as logical to use the present theory of the emotions
for proving that sensational processes need not be vile and
material, as to use their vileness and materiality as a proof
that such a theory cannot be true.</p>

<p>If such a theory is true, then each emotion is the resultant
of a sum of elements, and each element is caused by a
physiological process of a sort already well known. The
elements are all organic changes, and each of them is the
reflex effect of the exciting object. Definite questions now
immediately arise&mdash;questions very different from those
which were the only possible ones without this view. Those
were questions of classification: "Which are the proper genera
of emotion, and which the species under each?" or of
description: "By what expression is each emotion characterized?"
The questions now are <i>causal</i>: "Just what
changes does this object and what changes does that object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
excite?" and "How come they to excite these particular
changes and not others?" We step from a superficial to a
deep order of inquiry. Classification and description are
the lowest stage of science. They sink into the background
the moment questions of genesis are formulated, and remain
important only so far as they facilitate our answering these.
Now the moment the genesis of an emotion is accounted for,
as the arousal by an object of a lot of reflex acts which are
forthwith felt, <i>we immediately see why there is no limit to the
number of possible different emotions which may exist, and why
the emotions of different individuals may vary indefinitely,</i> both
as to their constitution and as to objects which call them
forth. For there is nothing sacramental or eternally fixed
in reflex action. Any sort of reflex effect is possible, and
reflexes actually vary indefinitely, as we know.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have all seen men dumb, instead of talkative, with joy; we
have seen fright drive the blood into the head of its victim, instead of
making him pale; we have seen grief run restlessly about lamenting,
instead of sitting bowed down and mute; etc., etc., and this naturally
enough, for one and the same cause can work differently on different
men's blood-vessels (since these do not always react alike), whilst moreover
the impulse on its way through the brain to the vaso-motor centre
is differently influenced by different earlier impressions in the form of
recollections or associations of ideas."<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In short, <i>any classification of the emotions is seen to be as
true and as 'natural' as any other,</i> if it only serves some purpose;
and such a question as "What is the 'real' or 'typical'
expression of anger, or fear?" is seen to have no objective
meaning at all. Instead of it we now have the question as
to how any given 'expression' of anger or fear may have
come to exist; and that is a real question of physiological
mechanics on the one hand, and of history on the other,
which (like all real questions) is in essence answerable,
although the answer may be hard to find. On a later page
I shall mention the attempts to answer it which have been
made.</p>


<h4>DIFFICULTY OF TESTING THE THEORY EXPERIMENTALLY.</h4>


<p>I have thus fairly propounded what seems to me the
most fruitful way of conceiving of the emotions. It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
be admitted that it is so far only a hypothesis, only <i>possibly</i>
a true conception, and that much is lacking to its
definite proof. The only way coercively to <i>dis</i>prove it,
however, would be to take some emotion, and then exhibit
qualities of feeling in it which should be <i>demonstrably</i> additional
to all those which could possibly be derived from
the organs affected at the time. But to detect with certainty
such purely spiritual qualities of feeling would
obviously be a task beyond human power. We have, as
Professor Lange says, absolutely no immediate criterion by
which to distinguish between spiritual and corporeal feelings;
and, I may add, the more we sharpen our introspection,
the more <i>localized</i> all our qualities of feeling become (see
above, Vol. I. p. 300) and the more difficult the discrimination
consequently grows.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>A positive proof of the theory would, on the other hand,
be given if we could find a subject absolutely anæsthetic
inside and out, but not paralytic, so that emotion-inspiring
objects might evoke the usual bodily expressions from him,
but who, on being consulted, should say that no subjective
emotional affection was felt. Such a man would be like one
who, because he eats, appears to bystanders to be hungry,
but who afterwards confesses that he had no appetite at
all. Cases like this are extremely hard to find. Medical
literature contains reports, so far as I know, of but three.
In the famous one of Remigius Leins no mention is made
by the reporters of his emotional condition. In Dr. G.
Winter's case<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> the patient is said to be inert and phlegmatic,
but no particular attention, as I learn from Dr. W.,
was paid to his psychic condition. In the extraordinary
case reported by Professor Strümpell (to which I must refer
later in another connection)<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> we read that the patient, a
shoemaker's apprentice of fifteen, entirely anæsthetic, inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
and out, with the exception of one eye and one ear, had
shown <i>shame</i> on the occasion of soiling his bed, and <i>grief</i>,
when a formerly favorite dish was set before him, at the
thought that he could no longer taste its flavor. Dr. Strümpell
is also kind enough to inform me that he manifested
<i>surprise, fear,</i> and <i>anger</i> on certain occasions. In observing
him, however, no such theory as the present one seems
to have been thought of; and it always remains possible
that, just as he satisfied his natural appetites and necessities
in cold blood, with no inward feeling, so his emotional
expressions may have been accompanied by a quite cold
heart.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Any new case which turns up of generalized anæsthesia
ought to be carefully examined as to the inward
emotional sensibility as distinct from the 'expressions' of
emotion which circumstances may bring forth.</p>


<h4><i>Objections Considered</i>.</h4>


<p>Let me now notice a few objections. The replies will
make the theory still more plausible.</p>

<p><i>First Objection</i>. There is no real evidence, it may be said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
for the assumption that particular perceptions <i>do</i> produce
wide-spread bodily effects by a sort of immediate physical
influence, antecedent to the arousal of an emotion or emotional
idea.</p>

<p><i>Reply.</i> There is most assuredly such evidence. In
listening to poetry, drama, or heroic narrative we are often
surprised at the cutaneous shiver which like a sudden wave
flows over us, and at the heart-swelling and the lachrymal
effusion that unexpectedly catch us at intervals. In listening
to music the same is even more strikingly true. If we
abruptly see a dark moving form in the woods, our heart
stops beating, and we catch our breath instantly and before
any articulate idea of danger can arise. If our friend goes
near to the edge of a precipice, we get the well-known feeling
of 'all-overishness,' and we shrink back, although we
positively <i>know</i> him to be safe, and have no distinct imagination
of his fall. The writer well remembers his astonishment,
when a boy of seven or eight, at fainting when he
saw a horse bled. The blood was in a bucket, with a stick
in it, and, if memory does not deceive him, he stirred
it round and saw it drip from the stick with no feeling
save that of childish curiosity. Suddenly the world grew
black before his eyes, his ears began to buzz, and he knew
no more. He had never heard of the sight of blood producing
faintness or sickness, and he had so little repugnance
to it, and so little apprehension of any other sort of danger
from it, that even at that tender age, as he well remembers,
he could not help wondering how the mere physical presence
of a pailful of crimson fluid could occasion in him
such formidable bodily effects.</p>

<p>Professor Lange writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No one has ever thought of separating the emotion produced by
an unusually loud sound from the true inward affections. No one
hesitates to call it a sort of fright, and it shows the ordinary signs of
fright. And yet it is by no means combined with the idea of danger,
or in any way occasioned by associations, memories, or other mental
processes. The phenomena of flight follow the noise immediately without
a trace of 'spiritual' fear. Many men can never grow used to
standing beside a cannon when it is fired off, although they perfectly
know that there is danger neither for themselves nor for others&mdash;the
bare sound is too much for them."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>
<p>Imagine two steel knife-blades with their keen edges
crossing each other at right angles, and moving to and fro.
Our whole nervous organization is 'on-edge' at the thought;
and yet what emotion can be there except the unpleasant
nervous feeling itself, or the dread that more of it may come?
The entire fund and capital of the emotion here is the
senseless bodily effect which the blades immediately arouse.
This case is typical of a class: where an ideal emotion
seems to precede the bodily symptoms, it is often nothing
but an anticipation of the symptoms themselves. One who
has already fainted at the sight of blood may witness the
preparations for a surgical operation with uncontrollable
heart-sinking and anxiety. He anticipates certain feelings,
and the anticipation precipitates their arrival. In cases of
morbid terror the subjects often confess that what possesses
them seems, more than anything, to be fear of the fear itself.
In the various forms of what Professor Bain calls 'tender
emotion,' although the appropriate object must usually be
directly contemplated before the emotion can be aroused,
yet sometimes thinking of the symptoms of the emotion
itself may have the same effect. In sentimental natures
the thought of 'yearning' will produce real 'yearning.'
And, not to speak of coarser examples, a mother's imagination
of the caresses she bestows on her child may arouse
a spasm of parental longing.</p>

<p>In such cases as these we see plainly how the emotion
both begins and ends with what we call its effects or manifestations.
It has no mental <i>status</i> except as either the
vivid feeling of the manifestations, or the idea of them;
and the latter thus constitute its entire material, and sum
and substance. And these cases ought to make us see
how in all cases the feeling of the manifestations may play
a much deeper part in the constitution of the emotion than
we are wont to suppose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The best proof that the immediate cause of emotion is
a physical effect on the nerves is furnished by <i>those pathological
cases in which the emotion is objectless</i>. One of the
chief merits, in fact, of the view which I propose seems
to be that we can so easily formulate by its means pathological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
cases and normal cases under a common scheme.
In every asylum we find examples of absolutely unmotived
fear, anger, melancholy, or conceit; and others of an
equally unmotived apathy which persists in spite of the
best of outward reasons why it should give way. In the
former cases we must suppose the nervous machinery to be
so 'labile' in some one emotional direction that almost
every stimulus (however inappropriate) causes it to upset
in that way, and to engender the particular complex
of feelings of which the psychic body of the emotion
consists. Thus, to take one special instance, if inability
to draw deep breath, fluttering of the heart, and that
peculiar epigastric change felt as 'precordial anxiety,'
with an irresistible tendency to take a somewhat crouching
attitude and to sit still, and with perhaps other visceral
processes not now known, all spontaneously occur together
in a certain person; his feeling of their combination <i>is</i> the
emotion of dread, and he is the victim of what is known as
morbid fear. A friend who has had occasional attacks of
this most distressing of all maladies tells me that in his
case the whole drama seems to centre about the region of
the heart and respiratory apparatus, that his main effort
during the attacks is to get control of his inspirations and
to slow his heart, and that the moment he attains to breathing
deeply and to holding himself erect, the dread, <i>ipso
facto</i>, seems to depart.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>The emotion here is nothing but the feeling of a bodily
state, and it has a purely bodily cause.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"All physicians who have been much engaged in general practice
have seen cases of dyspepsia in which constant low spirits and occasional
attacks of terror rendered the patient's condition pitiable in the
extreme. I have observed these cases often, and have watched them
closely, and I have never seen greater suffering of any kind than I have
witnessed during these attacks.... Thus, a man is suffering from
what we call nervous dyspepsia. Some day, we will suppose in the
middle of the afternoon, without any warning or visible cause, one of
these attacks of terror comes on. The first thing the man feels is great
but vague discomfort. Then he notices that his heart is beating much
too violently. At the same time shocks or flashes as of electrical discharges,
so violent as to be almost painful, pass one after another
through his body and limbs. Then in a few minutes he falls into a
condition of the most intense fear. He is not afraid of anything; he is
simply afraid. His mind is perfectly clear. He looks for a cause of
his wretched condition, but sees none. Presently his terror is such
that he trembles violently and utters low moans; his body is damp
with perspiration; his mouth is perfectly dry; and at this stage there
are no tears in his eyes, though his suffering is intense. When the
climax of the attack is reached and passed, there is a copious flow of
tears, or else a mental condition in which the person weeps upon the
least provocation. At this stage a large quantity of pale urine is passed.
Then the heart's action becomes again normal, and the attack passes
off."<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There are outbreaks of rage so groundless and unbridled that
all must admit them to be expressions of disease. For the medical
layman hardly anything can be more instructive than the observation
of such a pathological attack of rage, especially when it presents itself
pure and unmixed with other psychical disturbances. This happens in
that rather rare disease named transitory mania. The patient predisposed
to this&mdash;otherwise an entirely reasonable person&mdash;will be attacked
suddenly without the slightest outward provocation, and thrown (to use
the words of the latest writer on the subject, O. Schwartzer, Die transitorische
Tobsucht, Wien, 1880), 'into a paroxysm of the wildest rage, with
a fearful and blindly furious impulse to do violence and destroy.'
He flies at those about him; strikes, kicks, and throttles whomever he
can catch; dashes every object about which he can lay his hands on;
breaks and crushes what is near him; tears his clothes; shouts, howls,
and roars, with eyes that flash and roll, and shows meanwhile all those
symptoms of vaso-motor congestion which we have learned to know as
the concomitants of anger. His face is red, swollen, his cheeks hot, his
eyes protuberant and their whites bloodshot, the heart beats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
violently, the pulse marks 100-120 strokes a minutes. The arteries of the
neck are full and pulsating, the veins are swollen, the saliva flows. The
fit lasts only a few hours, and ends suddenly with a sleep of from 8 to
12 hours, on waking from which the patient has entirely forgotten what
has happened."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In these (outwardly) causeless emotional conditions the
particular paths which are explosive are discharged by any
and every incoming sensation. Just as, when we are seasick,
every smell, every taste, every sound, every sight, every
movement, every sensible experience whatever, augments
our nausea, so the morbid terror or anger is increased by
each and every sensation which stirs up the nerve-centres.
Absolute quiet is the only treatment for the time. It
seems impossible not to admit that in all this the bodily
condition takes the lead, and that the mental emotion follows.
The <i>intellect</i> may, in fact, be so little affected as to
play the cold-blooded spectator all the while, and note the
absence of a real object for the emotion.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>A few words from Henle may close my reply to this first
objection:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Does it not seem as if the excitations of the bodily nerves met the
ideas half way, in order to raise the latter to the height of emotions?
[Note how justly this expresses our theory!] That they do so is proved
by the cases in which particular nerves, when specially irritable, share
in the emotion and determine its quality. When one is suffering from
an open wound, any grievous or horrid spectacle will cause pain in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
wound. In sufferers from heart-disease there is developed a psychic
excitability, which is often incomprehensible to the patients themselves,
but which comes from the heart's liability to palpitate. I said that the
very quality of the emotion is determined by the organs disposed to
participate in it. Just as surely as a dark foreboding, rightly grounded
on inference from the constellations, will be accompanied by a feeling
of oppression in the chest, so surely will a similar feeling of oppression,
when due to disease of the thoracic organs, be accompanied by groundless
forebodings. So small a thing as a bubble of air rising from the
stomach through the œsophagus, and loitering on its way a few minutes
and exerting pressure on the heart, is able during sleep to occasion a
nightmare, and during waking to produce a vague anxiety. On the
other hand, we see that joyous thoughts dilate our blood-vessels, and
that a suitable quantity of wine, because it dilates the vessels, also disposes
us to joyous thoughts. If both the jest and the wine work together,
they supplement each other in producing the emotional effect,
and our demands on the jest are the more modest in proportion as the
wine takes upon itself a larger part of the task."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Second Objection.</i> If our theory be true, a necessary
corollary of it ought to be this: that any voluntary and
cold-blooded arousal of the so-called manifestations of a
special emotion ought to give us the emotion itself. Now
this (the objection says) is not found to be the case. An
actor can perfectly simulate an emotion and yet be inwardly
cold; and we can all pretend to cry and not feel grief;
and feign laughter without being amused.</p>

<p><i>Reply.</i> In the majority of emotions this test is inapplicable;
for many of the manifestations are in organs over
which we have no voluntary control. Few people in pretending
to cry can shed real tears, for example. But,
within the limits in which it can be verified, experience
corroborates rather than disproves the corollary from our
theory, upon which the present objection rests. Every
one knows how panic is increased by flight, and how the
giving way to the symptoms of grief or anger increases
those passions themselves. Each fit of sobbing makes the
sorrow more acute, and calls forth another fit stronger still,
until at last repose only ensues with lassitude and with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
apparent exhaustion of the machinery. In rage, it is notorious
how we 'work ourselves up' to a climax by repeated
outbreaks of expression. Refuse to express a passion,
and it dies. Count ten before venting your anger,
and its occasion seems ridiculous. Whistling to keep up
courage is no mere figure of speech. On the other hand,
sit all day in a moping posture, sigh, and reply to everything
with a dismal voice, and your melancholy lingers.
There is no more valuable precept in moral education than
this, as all who have experience know: if we wish to conquer
undesirable emotional tendencies in ourselves, we
must assiduously, and in the first instance cold-bloodedly,
go through the <i>outward movements</i> of those contrary dispositions
which we prefer to cultivate. The reward of persistency
will infallibly come, in the fading out of the sullenness
or depression, and the advent of real cheerfulness and
kindliness in their stead. Smooth the brow, brighten the
eye, contract the dorsal rather than the ventral aspect of
the frame, and speak in a major key, pass the genial compliment,
and your heart must be frigid indeed if it do not
gradually thaw!</p>

<p>This is recognized by all psychologists, only they fail to
see its full import. Professor Bain writes, for example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We find that a feeble [emotional] wave... is suspended inwardly
by being arrested outwardly; the currents of the brain and the agitation
of the centres die away if the external vent is resisted at every
point. It is by such restraint that we are in the habit of suppressing
pity, anger, fear, pride&mdash;on many trifling occasions. If so, it is a fact
that the suppression of the actual movements has a tendency to suppress
the nervous currents that incite them, so that the external quiescence
is followed by the internal. The effect would not happen in any
case <i>if there were not some dependence of the cerebral wave upon the
free outward vent or manifestation</i>.... By the same interposition
we may summon up a dormant feeling. By acting out the external
manifestations, we gradually infect the nerves leading to them, and
finally waken up the diffusive current by a sort of action <i>ab extra</i>....
Thus it is that we are sometimes able to assume a cheerful tone of mind
by forcing a hilarious expression."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span></p>
<p>We have a mass of other testimony of similar effect.
Burke, in his treatise on the Sublime and Beautiful, writes
as follows of the physiognomist Campanella:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This man, it seems, had not only made very accurate observations
on human faces, but was very expert in mimicking such as were in any
way remarkable. When he had a mind to penetrate into the inclinations
of those he had to deal with, he composed his face, his gesture, and his
whole body, as nearly as he could, into the exact similitude of the person
he intended to examine; and then carefully observed what turn of
mind he seemed to acquire by the change. So that, says my author, he
was able to enter into the dispositions and thoughts of people as effectually
as if he had been changed into the very men. I have often observed
[Burke now goes on in his own person] that, on mimicking the
looks and gestures of angry, or placid, or frightened, or daring men, I
have involuntarily found my mind turned to that passion whose appearance
I strove to imitate; nay, I am convinced it is hard to avoid it,
though one strove to separate the passion from its corresponding gestures."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Against this it is to be said that many actors who perfectly
mimic the outward appearances of emotion in face,
gait, and voice declare that they feel no emotion at all.
Others, however, according to Mr. Wm. Archer, who has
made a very instructive statistical inquiry among them,
say that the emotion of the part masters them whenever
they play it well.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I often turn pale,' writes Miss Isabel Bateman, 'in scenes of
terror or great excitement. I have been told this many times, and I
can feel myself getting very cold and shivering and pale in thrilling
situations.' 'When I am playing rage or terror,' writes Mr. Lionel
Brough, 'I believe I do turn pale. My mouth gets dry, my tongue
cleaves to my palate. In Bob Acres, for instance (in the last act), I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
have to continually moisten my mouth, or I shall become inarticulate.
I have to "swallow the lump," as I call it.' All artists who have had
much experience of emotional parts are absolutely unanimous....
'Playing with the brain,' says Miss Alma Murray, 'is far less fatiguing
than playing with the heart. An adventuress taxes the physique far
less than a sympathetic heroine. Muscular exertion has comparatively
little to do with it.'... 'Emotion while acting,' writes Mr. Howe, 'will
induce perspiration much more than physical exertion. I always perspired
profusely while acting Joseph Surface, which requires little or
no exertion.'... 'I suffer from fatigue,' writes Mr. Forbes Robertson,
'in proportion to the amount of emotion I may have been called upon
to go through, and not from physical exertion.'... 'Though I have
played Othello,' writes Mr. Coleman, 'ever since I was seventeen (at
nineteen I had the honor of acting the Moor to Macready's Iago), husband
my resources as I may, this is the one part, the part of parts,
which always leaves me physically prostrate. I have never been able to
find a pigment that would stay on my face, though I have tried every
preparation in existence. Even the titanic Edwin Forrest told me that
he was always knocked over in Othello, and I have heard Charles
Kean, Phelps, Brooke, Dillion, say the same thing. On the other hand,
I have frequently acted Richard III. without turning a hair.'"<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The explanation for the discrepancy amongst actors is
probably that which these quotations suggest. The <i>visceral
and organic</i> part of the expression can be suppressed
in some men, but not in others, and on this it is probable
that the chief part of the felt emotion depends. Coquelin
and the other actors who are inwardly cold are probably
able to affect the dissociation in a complete way. Prof.
Sikorsky of Kieff has contributed an important article on
the facial expression of the insane to the Neurologisches
Centralblatt for 1887. Having practised facial mimicry
himself a great deal, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I contract my facial muscles in any mimetic combination, <i>I
feel no emotional excitement,</i> so that the mimicry is in the fullest sense
of the word artificial, although quite irreproachable from the expressive
point of view."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We find, however, from the context that Prof. S.'s practice
before the mirror has developed in him such a virtuosity
in the control of his facial muscles that he can entirely
disregard their natural association and contract them in
any order of grouping, on either side of the face isolatedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
and each one alone. Probably in him the facial mimicry
is an entirely restricted and localized thing, without sympathetic
changes of any sort elsewhere.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Third Objection.</i> Manifesting an emotion, so far from
increasing it, makes it cease. Rage evaporates after a good
outburst; it is <i>pent-up</i> emotions that "work like madness
in the brain."</p>

<p><i>Reply.</i> The objection fails to discriminate between
what is felt <i>during</i> and what is felt <i>after</i> the manifestation.
<i>During</i> the manifestation the emotion is always felt. In
the normal course of things this, being the natural channel
of discharge, exhausts the nerve-centres, and emotional
calm ensues. But if tears or anger are simply suppressed,
whilst the object of grief or rage remains unchanged before
the mind, the current which would have invaded the normal
channels turns into others, for it must find some outlet
of escape. It may then work different and worse effects
later on. Thus vengeful brooding may replace a burst of
indignation; a dry heat may consume the frame of one who
fain would weep, or he may, as Dante says, turn to stone
within; and then tears or a storming fit may bring a grateful
relief. This is when the current is strong enough to
strike into a pathological path when the normal one is
dammed. When this is so, an immediate outpour may be
best. But here, to quote Prof. Bain again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is nothing more implied than the fact that an emotion may
be too strong to be resisted, and we only waste our strength in the
endeavor. If we are really able to stem the torrent, there is no more
reason for refraining from the attempt than in the case of weaker
feelings. And undoubtedly the <i>habitual</i> control of the emotions is not
to be attained without a systematic restraint, extended to weak and
strong."</p></blockquote>

<p>When we teach children to repress their emotional talk
and display, it is not that they may <i>feel</i> more&mdash;quite the
reverse. It is that they may <i>think</i> more; for, to a certain
extent, whatever currents are diverted from the regions
below, must swell the activity of the thought-tracts of the
brain. In apoplexies and other brain injuries we get the
opposite condition&mdash;an obstruction, namely, to the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
of currents among the thought-tracts, and with this an increased
tendency of objects to start downward currents
into the organs of the body. The consequence is tears,
laughter, and temper-fits, on the most insignificant provocation,
accompanying a proportional feebleness in logical
thought and the power of volitional attention and decision,&mdash;just
the sort of thing from which we try to wean our child.
It is true that we say of certain persons that "they would
feel more if they expressed less." And in another class of
persons the explosive energy with which passion manifests
itself on critical occasions seems correlated with the way
in which they bottle it up during the intervals. But these
are only eccentric types of character, and within each type
the law of the last paragraph prevails. The sentimentalist
is so constructed that 'gushing' is his or her normal mode
of expression. Putting a stopper on the 'gush' will only
to a limited extent cause more 'real' activities to take its
place; in the main it will simply produce listlessness. On
the other hand, the ponderous and bilious 'slumbering volcano,'
let him repress the expression of his passions as he
will, will find them expire if they get no vent at all; whilst
if the rare occasions multiply which he deems worthy of
their outbreak, he will find them grow in intensity as life
proceeds. On the whole, I cannot see that this third objection
carries any weight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If our hypothesis is true, it makes us realize more deeply
than ever how much our mental life is knit up with our
corporeal frame, in the strictest sense of the term. Rapture,
love, ambition, indignation, and pride, considered as
feelings, are fruits of the same soil with the grossest bodily
sensations of pleasure and of pain. But the reader will
remember that we agreed at the outset to affirm this only
of what we then called the 'coarser' emotions, and that
those inward states of emotional sensibility which appeared
devoid at first sight of bodily results should be left out of
our account. We must now say a word or two about these
latter feelings, the 'subtler' emotions, as we then agreed to
call them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE SUBTLER EMOTIONS.</h4>


<p>These are the moral, intellectual, and æsthetic feelings.
Concords of sounds, of colors, of lines, logical consistencies,
teleological fitnesses, affect us with a pleasure that seems
ingrained in the very form of the representation itself, and
to borrow nothing from any reverberation surging up from
the parts below the brain. The Herbartian psychologists
have distinguished feelings due to the <i>form</i> in which ideas
may be arranged. A mathematical demonstration may be
as 'pretty,' and an act of justice as 'neat,' as a drawing or
a tune, although the prettiness and neatness seem to have
nothing to do with sensation. We have, then, or some of
us seem to have, genuinely <i>cerebral</i> forms of pleasure and
displeasure, apparently not agreeing in their mode of production
with the 'coarser' emotions we have been analyzing.
And it is certain that readers whom our reasons have hitherto
failed to convince will now start up at this admission, and
consider that by it we give up our whole case. Since musical
perceptions, since logical ideas, can immediately arouse
a form of emotional feeling, they will say, is it not more
natural to suppose that in the case of the so-called 'coarser'
emotions, prompted by other kinds of objects, the emotional
feeling is equally immediate, and the bodily expression
something that comes later and is added on?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In reply to this we must immediately insist that æsthetic
emotion, <i>pure and simple,</i> the pleasure given us by certain
lines and masses, and combinations of colors and sounds, is
an absolutely sensational experience, an optical or auricular
feeling that is primary, and not due to the repercussion
backwards of other sensations elsewhere consecutively
aroused. To this simple primary and immediate pleasure
in certain pure sensations and harmonious combinations
of them, there may, it is true, be <i>added</i> secondary pleasures;
and in the practical enjoyment of works of art by
the masses of mankind these secondary pleasures play a
great part. The more <i>classic</i> one's taste is, however, the
less relatively important are the secondary pleasures felt to
be in comparison with those of the primary sensation as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
comes in.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Classicism and romanticism have their battles
over this point. Complex suggestiveness, the awakening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
vistas of memory and association, and the stirring of our
flesh with picturesque mystery and gloom, make a work of
art <i>romantic</i>. The classic taste brands these effects as coarse
and tawdry, and prefers the naked beauty of the optical and
auditory sensations, unadorned with frippery or foliage. To
the romantic mind, on the contrary, the immediate beauty
of these sensations seems dry and thin. I am of course not
discussing which view is right, but only showing that the discrimination
between the primary feeling of beauty, as a
pure incoming sensible quality, and the secondary emotions
which are grafted thereupon, is one that must be made.</p>

<p>These secondary emotions themselves are assuredly for
the most part constituted of other incoming sensations
aroused by the diffusive wave of reflex effects which the
beautiful object sets up. A glow, a pang in the breast,
a shudder, a fulness of the breathing, a flutter of the
heart, a shiver down the back, a moistening of the eyes, a
stirring in the hypogastrium, and a thousand unnamable
symptoms besides, may be felt the moment the beauty
<i>excites</i> us. And these symptoms also result when we are excited
by moral perceptions, as of pathos, magnanimity, or
courage. The voice breaks and the sob rises in the struggling
chest, or the nostril dilates and the fingers tighten,
whilst the heart beats, etc., etc.</p>

<p>As far as <i>these ingredients</i> of the subtler emotions go,
then, the latter form no exception to our account, but
rather an additional illustration thereof. In all cases of
intellectual or moral rapture we find that, unless there be
coupled a bodily reverberation of some kind with the mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
thought of the object and cognition of its quality; unless
we actually laugh at the neatness of the demonstration or
witticism; unless we thrill at the case of justice, or tingle
at the act of magnanimity; our state of mind can hardly be
called emotional at all. It is in fact a mere intellectual
perception of how certain things are to be called&mdash;neat,
right, witty, generous, and the like. Such a judicial state
of mind as this is to be classed among awarenesses of truth;
it is a <i>cognitive</i> act. As a matter of fact, however, the
moral and intellectual cognitions hardly ever do exist thus
unaccompanied. The bodily sounding-board is at work, as
careful introspection will show, far more than we usually
suppose. Still, where long familiarity with a certain class
of effects, even æsthetic ones, has blunted mere emotional
excitability as much as it has sharpened taste and judgment,
we do get the intellectual emotion, if such it can be
called, pure and undefiled. And the dryness of it, the
paleness, the absence of all glow, as it may exist in a
thoroughly expert critic's mind, not only shows us what
an altogether different thing it is from the 'coarser' emotions
we considered first, but makes us suspect that almost
the entire difference lies in the fact that the bodily sounding-board,
vibrating in the one case, is in the other mute.
"Not so very bad" is, in a person of consummate taste,
apt to be the highest limit of approving expression. "<i>Rien
ne me choque</i>" is said to have been Chopin's superlative of
praise of new music. A sentimental layman would feel,
and ought to feel, horrified, on being admitted into such a
critic's mind, to see how cold, how thin, how void of human
significance, are the motives for favor or disfavor that
there prevail. The capacity to make a nice spot on the
wall will outweigh a picture's whole content; a foolish
trick of words will preserve a poem; an utterly meaningless
fitness of sequence in one musical composition set at
naught any amount of 'expressiveness' in another.</p>

<p>I remember seeing an English couple sit for more than
an hour on a piercing February day in the Academy at
Venice before the celebrated 'Assumption' by Titian;
and when I, after being chased from room to room by the
cold, concluded to get into the sunshine as fast as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
and let the pictures go, but before leaving drew reverently
near to them to learn with what superior forms of susceptibility
they might be endowed, all I overheard was the
woman's voice murmuring: "What a <i>deprecatory</i> expression
her face wears! What self-abneg<i>ation!</i> How <i>unworthy</i>
she feels of the honor she is receiving!" Their honest
hearts had been kept warm all the time by a glow of spurious
sentiment that would have fairly made old Titian sick.
Mr. Ruskin somewhere makes the (for him terrible) admission
that religious people as a rule care little for pictures,
and that when they do care for them they generally prefer
the worst ones to the best. Yes! in every art, in every
science, there is the keen perception of certain relations
being <i>right</i> or not, and there is the emotional flush and thrill
consequent thereupon. And these are two things, not one.
In the former of them it is that experts and masters are at
home. The latter accompaniments are bodily commotions
that they may hardly feel, but that may be experienced in
their fulness by <i>crétins</i> and philistines in whom the critical
judgment is at its lowest ebb. The 'marvels' of Science,
about which so much edifying popular literature is written,
are apt to be 'caviare' to the men in the laboratories. And
even divine Philosophy itself, which common mortals consider
so 'sublime' an occupation, on account of the vastness
of its data and outlook, is too apt to the practical
philosopher himself to be but a sharpening and tightening
business, a matter of 'points,' of screwing down things, of
splitting hairs, and of the 'intent' rather than the 'extent'
of conceptions. Very little emotion here!&mdash;except the
effort of setting the attention fine, and the feeling of ease
and relief (mainly in the breathing apparatus) when the
inconsistencies are overcome and the thoughts run smoothly
for a while. Emotion and cognition seem then parted even
in this last retreat; and cerebral processes are almost feelingless,
so far as we can judge, until they summon help
from parts below.</p>


<h4>NO SPECIAL BRAIN-CENTRES FOR EMOTION.</h4>


<p>If the neural process underlying emotional consciousness
be what I have now sought to prove it, the physiology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
of the brain becomes a simpler matter than has been
hitherto supposed. Sensational, associational, and motor
elements are all that the organ need contain. The physiologists
who, during the past few years, have been so industriously
exploring the brain's functions, have limited
their explanations to its cognitive and volitional performances.
Dividing the brain into sensory and motor
centres, they have found their division to be exactly paralleled
by the analysis made by empirical psychology of
the perceptive and volitional parts of the mind into their
simplest elements. But the emotions have been so ignored
in all these researches that one is tempted to suppose that
if these investigators were asked for a theory of them
in brain-terms, they would have to reply, either that they
had as yet bestowed no thought upon the subject, or that
they had found it so difficult to make distinct hypotheses
that the matter lay among the problems of the future, only
to be taken up after the simpler ones of the present should
have been definitively solved.</p>

<p>And yet it is even now certain that of two things concerning
the emotions, one must be true. Either separate
and special centres, affected to them alone, are their brain-seat,
or else they correspond to processes occurring in the
motor and sensory centres already assigned, or in others
like them, not yet known. If the former be the case, we
must deny the view that is current, and hold the cortex to
be something more than the surface of 'projection' for every
sensitive spot and every muscle in the body. If the latter
be the case, we must ask whether the emotional <i>process</i>
in the sensory or motor centre be an altogether peculiar
one, or whether it resembles the ordinary perceptive processes
of which those centres are already recognized to be
the seat. Now if the theory I have defended be true, the
latter alternative is all that it demands. Supposing the
cortex to contain parts, liable to be excited by changes
in each special sense-organ, in each portion of the skin,
in each muscle, each joint, and each viscus, and to contain
absolutely nothing else, we still have a scheme capable of
representing the process of the emotions. An object falls
on a sense-organ, affects a cortical part, and is perceived;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
or else the latter, excited inwardly, gives rise to an idea of
the same object. Quick as a flash, the reflex currents pass
down through their preordained channels, alter the condition
of muscle, skin, and viscus; and these alterations,
perceived, like the original object, in as many portions of
the cortex, combine with it in consciousness and transform
it from an object-simply-apprehended into an object-emotionally-felt.
No new principles have to be invoked,
nothing postulated beyond the ordinary reflex circuits, and
the local centres admitted in one shape or another by all
to exist.</p>


<h4>EMOTIONAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.</h4>


<p><i>The revivability in memory of the emotions,</i> like that of all
the feelings of the lower senses, is very small. We can
remember that we underwent grief or rapture, but not just
how the grief or rapture felt. This difficult <i>ideal</i> revivability
is, however, more than compensated in the case of
the emotions by a very easy <i>actual</i> revivability. That
is, we can produce, not remembrances of the old grief
or rapture, but new griefs and raptures, by summoning up
a lively thought of their exciting cause. The cause is now
only an idea, but this idea produces the same organic
irradiations, or almost the same, which were produced by
its original, so that the emotion is again a reality. We
have 'recaptured' it. Shame, love, and anger are particularly
liable to be thus revived by ideas of their object.
Professor Bain admits<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> that "in their strict character of
emotion proper, they [the emotions] have the minimum of
revivability; but being always incorporated with the sensations
of the higher senses, they share in the superior revivability
of sights and sounds." But he fails to point out
that the revived sights and sounds may be <i>ideal</i> without
ceasing to be distinct; whilst the emotion, to be distinct,
must become real again. Prof. Bain seems to forget that
an 'ideal emotion' and a real emotion prompted by an
ideal object are two very different things.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>
<p><i>An emotional temperament on the one hand, and a
lively imagination for objects and circumstances on the other,
are thus the conditions, necessary and sufficient, for an
abundant emotional life.</i> No matter how emotional the
temperament may be, if the imagination be poor, the occasions
for touching off the emotional trains will fail to be
realized, and the life will be <i>pro tanto</i> cold and dry. This
is perhaps a reason why it may be better that a man of
thought should not have too strong a visualizing power.
He is less likely to have his trains of meditation disturbed
by emotional interruptions. It will be remembered that
Mr. Galton found the members of the Royal Society and of
the French Academy of Sciences to be below par in visualizing
power. If I may speak of myself, I am far less able
to visualize now, at the age of 46, than in my earlier years;
and I am strongly inclined to believe that the relative sluggishness
of my emotional life at present is quite as much
connected with this fact as it is with the invading torpor of
hoary eld, or with the omnibus-horse routine of settled professional
and domestic life. I say this because I occasionally
have a flash of the old stronger visual imagery, and I
notice that the emotional commentary, so to call it, is then
liable to become much more acute than is its present wont.
Charcot's patient, whose case is given above on <a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a> ff.,
complained of his incapacity for emotional feeling after his
optical images were gone. His mother's death, which in
former times would have wrung his heart, left him quite
cold; largely, as he himself suggests, because he could form
no definite visual image of the event, and of the effect of
the loss on the rest of the family at home.</p>

<p>One final generality about the emotions remains to be
noted: <i>They blunt themselves by repetition more rapidly than
any other sort of feeling.</i> This is due not only to the general
law of 'accommodation' to their stimulus which we
saw to obtain of all feelings whatever, but to the peculiar
fact that the 'diffusive wave' of reflex effects tends always
to become more narrow. It seems as if it were essentially
meant to be a provisional arrangement, on the basis of
which precise and determinate reactions might arise. The
more we exercise ourselves at anything, the fewer muscles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
we employ; and just so, the oftener we meet an object,
the more definitely we think and behave about it; and
the less is the organic perturbation to which it gives rise.
The first time we saw it we could perhaps neither act nor
think at all, and had no reaction but organic perturbation.
The emotions of startled surprise, wonder, or curiosity were
the result. Now we look on with absolutely no emotion.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
This tendency to economy in the nerve-paths through which
our sensations and ideas discharge, is the basis of all growth
in efficiency, readiness, and skill. Where would the general,
the surgeon, the presiding chairman, be, if their nerve-currents
kept running down into their viscera, instead of keeping
up amid their convolutions? But what they gain for practice
by this law, they lose, it must be confessed, for feeling.
For the world-worn and experienced man, the sense of
pleasure which he gets from the free and powerful flow of
thoughts, overcoming obstacles as they arise, is the only
compensation for that freshness of the heart which he once
enjoyed. This free and powerful flow means that brain-paths
of association and memory have more and more
organized themselves in him, and that through them the
stimulus is drafted off into nerves which lead merely to the
writing finger or the speaking tongue.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> The trains of <i>intellectual</i>
association, the memories, the logical relations, may,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
however, be voluminous in the extreme. Past emotions
may be among the things remembered. The more of all
these trains an object can set going in us, the richer our
cognitive intimacy with it is. This cerebral sense of richness
seems itself to be a source of pleasure, possibly
even apart from the <i>euphoria</i> which from time to time comes
up from respiratory organs. If there <i>be</i> such a thing as a
purely spiritual emotion, I should be inclined to restrict
it to this cerebral sense of abundance and ease, this
feeling, as Sir W. Hamilton would call it, of unimpeded
and not overstrained activity of thought. Under ordinary
conditions, it is a fine and serene but not an excited state
of consciousness. In certain intoxications it becomes
exciting, and it may be intensely exciting. I can hardly
imagine a more frenzied excitement than that which
goes with the consciousness of seeing absolute truth, which
characterizes the coming to from nitrous-oxide drunkenness.
Chloroform, ether, and alcohol all produce this
deepening sense of insight into truth; and with all of them
it may be a 'strong' emotion; but then there also come
with it all sorts of strange bodily feelings and changes in
the incoming sensibilities. I cannot see my way to affirming
that the emotion is independent of these. I will concede,
however, that if its independence is anywhere to be maintained,
these theoretic raptures seem the place at which
to begin the defence.</p>


<h4>THE GENESIS OF THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS.</h4>


<p>On a former page (<a href="#Page_453">pp. 453-4</a>) I said that two questions,
and only two, are important, if we regard the emotions as
constituted by feelings due to the diffusive wave.</p>

<p>(1) <i>What special diffusive effects do the various special objective
and subjective experiences excite?</i> and</p>

<p>(2) <i>How come they to excite them?</i></p>

<p>The works on physiognomy and expression are all of
them attempts to answer question 1. As is but natural, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
effects upon the face have received the most careful attention.
The reader who wishes details additional to those
given above on <a href="#Page_443">pp. 443-7</a> is referred to the works mentioned
in the note below.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>As regards question 2, some little progress has of recent
years been made in answering it. Two things are certain:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The facial muscles of expression are not given us
simply for expression's sake;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p><i>b.</i> Each muscle is not affected to some one emotion exclusively,
as certain writers have thought.</p>

<p>Some movements of expression can be accounted for
as <i>weakened repetitions of movements which formerly</i> (when
they were stronger) <i>were of utility to the subject.</i> Others
are similarly weakened repetitions of movements which
under other conditions were <i>physiologically necessary effects.</i>
Of the latter reactions the respiratory disturbances in
anger and fear might be taken as examples&mdash;organic
reminiscences, as it were, reverberations in imagination
of the blowings of the man making a series of combative
efforts, of the pantings of one in precipitate flight. Such
at least is a suggestion made by Mr. Spencer which has
found approval. And he also was the first, so far as I
know, to suggest that other movements in anger and fear
could be explained by the nascent excitation of formerly
useful acts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To have in a slight degree," he says, "such psychical states as accompany
the reception of wounds, and are experienced during flight, is
to be in a state of what we call fear. And to have in a slight degree
such psychical states as the processes of catching, killing, and eating
imply, is to have the desires to catch, kill, and eat. That the propensities
to the acts are nothing else than nascent excitations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
psychical state involved in the acts, is proved by the natural language
of the propensities. Fear, when strong, expresses itself in cries, in
efforts to escape, in palpitations, in tremblings; and these are just the
manifestations that go along with an actual suffering of the evil feared.
The destructive passion is shown in a general tension of the muscular
system, in gnashing of teeth and protrusion of the claws, in dilated eyes
and nostrils, in growls; and these are weaker forms of the actions that
accompany the killing of prey. To such objective evidences every one
can add subjective evidences. Every one can testify that the psychical
state called fear consists of mental representations of certain painful
results; and that the one called anger consists of mental representations
of the actions and impressions which would occur while inflicting
some kind of pain."<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>About fear I shall have more to say presently. Meanwhile
the principle of <i>revival in weakened form of reactions
useful in more violent dealings with the object inspiring the
emotion,</i> has found many applications. So slight a symptom
as the snarl or sneer, the one-sided uncovering of the upper
teeth, is accounted for by Darwin as a survival from the time
when our ancestors had large canines, and unfleshed them
(as dogs now do) for attack. Similarly the raising of the
eyebrows in outward attention, the opening of the mouth
in astonishment, come, according to the same author, from
the utility of these movements in extreme cases. The raising
of the eyebrows goes with the opening of the eye for better
vision; the opening of the mouth with the intensest listening,
and with the rapid catching of the breath which precedes
muscular effort. The distention of the nostrils in anger
is interpreted by Spencer as an echo of the way in which
our ancestors had to breathe when, during combat, their
"mouth was filled up by a part of an antagonist's body
that had been seized(!)." The trembling of fear is supposed
by Mantegazza to be for the sake of warming the blood(!).
The reddening of the face and neck is called by Wundt a
compensatory arrangement for relieving the brain of the
blood-pressure which the simultaneous excitement of the
heart brings with it. The effusion of tears is explained
both by this author and by Darwin to be a blood-withdrawing
agency of a similar sort. The contraction of the
muscles around the eyes, of which the primitive use is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
protect those organs from being too much gorged with
blood during the screaming fits of infancy, survives in
adult life in the shape of the frown, which instantly comes
over the brow when anything difficult or displeasing presents
itself either to thought or action.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As the habit of contracting the brows has been followed by infants
during innumerable generations, at the commencement of every crying
or screaming fit," says Darwin, "it has become firmly associated with
the incipient sense of something distressing or disagreeable. Hence,
under similar circumstances, it would be apt to be continued during
maturity, although never then developed, into a crying fit. Screaming
or weeping begins to be voluntarily restrained at an early period of life,
whereas frowning is hardly ever restrained at any age."<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The intermittent expirations which constitute laughter
have, according to Dr. Hecker, the purpose of counteracting
the anæmia of the brain, which he supposes to be
brought about by the action of the joyous or comic stimulus
upon the vaso-motor nerves.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> A smile is the weak vestige
of a laugh. The tight closure of the mouth in all effort is
useful for retaining the air in the lungs so as to fix the chest
and give a firm basis of insertion for the muscles of the
flanks. Accordingly, we see the lips compress themselves
upon every slight occasion of resolve. The blood-pressure
has to be high during the sexual embrace; hence the palpitations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
and hence also the tendency to caressing action,
which accompanies tender emotion in its fainter forms.
Other examples might be given; but these are quite
enough to show the scope of the principle of revival of
useful action in weaker form.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another principle, to which Darwin perhaps hardly
does sufficient justice, may be called the principle of
<i>reacting similarly to analogous-feeling stimuli</i>. There is a
whole vocabulary of descriptive adjectives common to impressions
belonging to different sensible spheres&mdash;experiences
of all classes are <i>sweet</i>, impressions of all classes <i>rich</i>
or <i>solid</i>, sensations of all classes <i>sharp</i>. Wundt and Piderit
accordingly explain many of our most expressive reactions
upon moral causes as symbolic gustatory movements. As
soon as any experience arises which has an affinity with the
feeling of sweet, or bitter, or sour, the same movements are
executed which would result from the taste in point.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
"All the states of mind which language designates by the
metaphors bitter, harsh, sweet, combine themselves, therefore,
with the corresponding mimetic movements of the
mouth." Certainly the emotions of disgust and satisfaction
do express themselves in this mimetic way. Disgust is
an incipient regurgitation or retching, limiting its expression
often to the grimace of the lips and nose; satisfaction
goes with a sucking smile, or tasting motion of the lips.
In Mantegazza's loose if learned work, the attempt is made,
much less successfully, to bring in the eye and ear as additional
sources of symbolically expressive reaction. The
ordinary gesture of negation&mdash;among us, moving the head
about its axis from side to side&mdash;is a reaction originally used
by babies to keep disagreeables from getting into their
mouth, and may be observed in perfection in any nursery.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
It is now evoked where the stimulus is only an unwelcome
idea. Similarly the nod forward in affirmation is after the
analogy of taking food into the mouth. The connection of
the expression of moral or social disdain or dislike, especially
in women, with movements having a perfectly definite
original olfactory function, is too obvious for comment.
Winking is the effect of any threatening surprise, not only
of what puts the eyes in danger; and a momentary aversion
of the eyes is very apt to be one's first symptom of response
to an unexpectedly unwelcome proposition.&mdash;These
may suffice as examples of movements expressive from
analogy.</p>

<p>But if certain of our emotional reactions can be explained
by the two principles invoked&mdash;and the reader will
himself have felt how conjectural and fallible in some of
the instances the explanation is&mdash;there remain many reactions
which cannot so be explained at all, and these we must
write down for the present as purely idiopathic effects of
the stimulus. Amongst them are the effects on the viscera
and internal glands, the dryness of the mouth and diarrhœa
and nausea of fear, the liver-disturbances which sometimes
produce jaundice after excessive rage, the urinary
secretion of sanguine excitement, and the bladder-contraction
of apprehension, the gaping of expectancy, the 'lump
in the throat' of grief, the tickling there and the swallowing
of embarrassment, the 'precordial anxiety' of dread,
the changes in the pupil, the various sweatings of the skin,
cold or hot, local or general, and its flushings, together
with other symptoms which probably exist but are too
hidden to have been noticed or named. It seems as if even
the changes of blood-pressure and heart-beat during emotional
excitement might, instead of being teleologically determined,
prove to be purely mechanical or physiological
outpourings through the easiest drainage-channels&mdash;the
pneumogastrics and sympathetic nerves happening under
ordinary circumstances to be such channels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Spencer argues that the <i>smallest</i> muscles must be
such channels; and instances the tail in dogs, cats, and
birds, the ears in horses, the crest in parrots, the face and
fingers in man, as the first organs to be moved by emotional
stimuli.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> This principle (if it be one) would apply still
more easily to the muscles of the smaller arteries (though
not exactly to the heart); whilst the great variability of the
circulatory symptoms would also suggest that they are determined
by causes into which utility does not enter. The
quickening of the heart lends itself, it is true, rather easily
to explanation by inherited habit, organic memory of more
violent excitement; and Darwin speaks in favor of this
view (see his Expression, etc., pp. 74-5). But, on the
other hand, we have so many cases of reaction which are
indisputably pathological, as we may say, and which could
never be serviceable or derived from what was serviceable,
that I think we should be cautious about pushing our explanations
of the varied heart-beat too far in the teleological
direction. Trembling, which is found in many excitements
besides that of terror, is, <i>pace</i> Mr. Spencer and Sig. Mantegazza,
quite pathological. So are terror's other strong
symptoms. Professor Mosso, as the total result of his
study, writes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have seen that the graver the peril becomes, the more do the
reactions which are positively harmful to the animal prevail in number
and in efficacy. We already saw that the trembling and the palsy make
it incapable of flight or defence; we have also convinced ourselves that
in the most decisive moments of danger we are less able to see [or to
think] than when we are tranquil. In face of such facts we must admit
that the phenomena of fear cannot all be accounted for by 'selection.'
Their extreme degrees are morbid phenomena which show an imperfection
in the organism. We might almost say that Nature had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
able to frame a substance which should be excitable enough to compose
the brain and spinal marrow, and yet which should not be so excited
by exceptional stimulation as to overstep in its reactions those
physiological bounds which are useful to the conservation of the creature."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Professor Bain, if I mistake not, had long previously
commented upon fear in a similar way.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin accounts for many emotional expressions
by what he calls the principle of antithesis. In virtue of
this principle, if a certain stimulus prompted a certain set
of movements, then a contrary-feeling stimulus would
prompt exactly the opposite movements, although these
might otherwise have neither utility nor significance. It is
in this wise that Darwin explains the expression of impotence,
raised eyebrows, and shrugged shoulders, dropped
arms and open palms, as being the antithesis of the frowning
brow, the thrown-back shoulders, and clenched fists of
rage, which is the emotion of power. No doubt a certain
number of movements can be formulated under this law;
but whether it expresses a <i>causal</i> principle is more than
doubtful. It has been by most critics considered the least
successful of Darwin's speculations on this subject.</p>

<p>To sum up, we see the reason for a few emotional reactions;
for others a possible species of reason may be
guessed; but others remain for which no plausible reason
can even be conceived. These may be reactions which are
purely mechanical results of the way in which our nervous
centres are framed, reactions which, although permanent
in us now, may be called accidental as far as their origin
goes. In fact, in an organism as complex as the nervous
system there <i>must</i> be many such reactions, incidental to
others evolved for utility's sake, but which would never
themselves have been evolved independently, for any utility
they might possess. Sea-sickness, the love of music, of
the various intoxicants, nay, the entire æsthetic life of man,
shall have to trace to this accidental origin.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> It would be
foolish to suppose that none of the reactions called emotional
could have arisen in this <i>quasi</i>-accidental way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<p>This is all I have to say about the emotions. If one
should seek to name each particular one of them of which
the human heart is the seat, it is plain that the limit to their
number would lie in the introspective vocabulary of the
seeker, each race of men having found names for some
shade of feeling which other races have left undiscriminated.
If then we should seek to break the emotions, thus
enumerated, into groups, according to their affinities, it is
again plain that all sorts of groupings would be possible,
according as we chose this character or that as a
basis, and that all groupings would be equally real and
true. The only question would be, does this grouping or
that suit our purpose best? The reader may then class
the emotions as he will, as sad or joyous, sthenic or
asthenic, natural or acquired, inspired by animate or inanimate
things, formal or material, sensuous or ideal, direct
or reflective, egoistic or non-egoistic, retrospective, prospective
or immediate, organismally or environmentally
initiated, or what more besides. All these are divisions
which have been actually proposed. Each of them has its
merits, and each one brings together some emotions which
the others keep apart. For a fuller account, and for other

the pulmonary artery. Professor J. Henle has, amongst his Anthropologische
Vorträge, an exquisite one on the 'Natural History of the Sigh,' in
which he represents our inspirations as the result of a battle between the
red muscles of our skeleton, ribs, and diaphragm, and the white ones of
the lungs, which seek to narrow the calibre of the air-tubes. "In the
normal state the former easily conquer, but under other conditions they
either conquer with difficulty or are defeated.... The contrasted emotions
express themselves in similarly contrasted wise, by spasm and paralysis
of the unstriped muscles, and for the most part alike in all the organs
which are provided with them, as arteries, skin, and bronchial tubes. The
contrast among the emotions is generally expressed by dividing them into
exciting and depressing ones. It is a remarkable fact that the depressing
emotions, like fear, horror, disgust, increase the contraction of these smooth
muscles, whilst the exciting emotions, like joy, anger, etc., make them
relax. Contrasts of temperature act similarly, cold like the depressing,
and warmth like the exciting, emotions. Cold produces pallor and goose-flesh,
warmth smooths out the skin and widens the vessels. If one notices
the uncomfortable mood brought about by strained expectation, anxiety
before a public address, vexation at an unmerited affront, etc., one finds that
the suffering part of it concentrates itself principally in the chest, and that
it consists in a soreness, hardly to be called pain, felt in the middle of the
breast and due to an unpleasant resistance which is offered to the movements
of inspiration, and sets a limit to their extent. The insufficiency of
the diaphragm is obtruded upon consciousness, and we try by the aid of
the external voluntary chest-muscles to draw a deeper breath. [This is the
sigh.] If we fail, the unpleasantness of the situation is increased, for then to
our mental distress is added the corporeally repugnant feeling of lack of air,
a slight degree of suffocation. If, on the contrary, the outer muscles overcome
the resistance of the inner ones, the oppressed breast is lightened.
We think we speak symbolically when we speak of a stone weighing on
our heart, or of a burden rolled from off our breast. But really we only
express the exact fact, for we should have to raise the entire weight of the
atmosphere (about 820 kilog.) at each inspiration, if the air did not balance
it by streaming into our lungs." (P. 55.) It must not be forgotten that an
inhibition of the inspiratory centre similar to that produced by exciting
the superior laryngeal nerve may possibly play a part in these phenomena.

with anxiety and fear, see 'A Case of Hydrophobia' by the lamented
Thos. B. Curtis in the Boston Med. and Surg. Journal, Nov. 7 and 14,

complete enough to be utilized in this inquiry. Moreover, the recent researches,
of which some account was given in Chapter IV, tend to show
that hysterical anæsthesia is not a real absence of sensibility, but a 'dissociation,'
as M. Pierre Janet calls it, or splitting-off of certain sensations
from the rest of the person's consciousness, this <i>rest</i> forming the self which
remains connected with the ordinary organs of expression. The split-off
consciousness forms a secondary self; and M. Janet writes me that he sees
no reason why sensations whose 'dissociation' from the body of consciousness
makes the patient practically anæsthetic, might not, nevertheless,
contribute to the emotional life of the patient. They do still contribute to
the function of locomotion; for in his patient L. there was no ataxia in spite
of the anæsthesia. M. Janet writes me, apropos of his anæsthetic patient
L., that she seemed to 'suffer by hallucination.' "I have often pricked or
burned her without warning, and when she did not see me. She never
moved, and evidently perceived nothing. But if afterwards in her movements
she caught sight of her wounded arm, and <i>saw</i> on her skin a little
drop of blood resulting from a slight cut, she would begin to cry out and
lament as if she suffered a great deal. 'My blood flows,' she said one day;
'I <i>must be</i> suffering a great deal!' She suffered by hallucination. This
sort of suffering is very general in hysterics. It is enough for them to receive
the slightest hint of a modification in their body, when their imagination
fills up the rest and invents changes that were not felt." See the
remarks published at a later date in Janet's Automatisme Psychologique,
pp. 214-15.</p></div>

objectively the heart is not much perturbed. These, however, fail to prove
anything against our theory, for it is of course possible that the cortical
centres normally percipient of dread as a complex of cardiac and other
organic sensations due to real bodily change, should become <i>primarily</i> excited
in brain-disease, and give rise to an hallucination of the changes
being there,&mdash;an hallucination of dread, consequently, coexistent with a
comparatively calm pulse, etc. I say it is possible, for I am ignorant of
observations which might test the fact. Trance, ecstasy, etc., offer analogous
examples,&mdash;not to speak of ordinary dreaming. Under all these conditions
one may have the liveliest subjective feelings, either of eye or ear,
or of the more visceral and emotional sort, as a result of pure nerve-central
activity, and yet, as I believe, with complete peripheral repose.</p></div>

rage, etc., the visceral disturbances are less strong than those which go to
outward expression. We have then a tremendous verbal display with a
hollow inside. Whilst the bystanders are wrung with compassion, or
pale with alarm, the subject all the while lets himself go, but feels his insincerity,
and wonders how long he can keep up the performance. The attacks
are often surprisingly sudden in their onset. The treatment here is to intimidate
the patient by a stronger will. Take out your temper, if he takes
out his&mdash;"Nay, if thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou." These are the
cases of apparently great bodily manifestation with comparatively little
real subjective emotion, which may be used to throw discredit on the theory
advanced in the text.&mdash;It is probable that the <i>visceral</i> manifestations in
these cases are quite disproportionately slight, compared with those of the
vocal organs. The subject's state is somewhat similar to that of an actor
who does not feel his part.</p></div>

Fechner (Vorschule der Aesthetik, 156) says almost the same thing of himself:

bodily expression of a mental condition makes us understand it much
better than the merely looking on.... When I walk behind some one
whom I do not know, and imitate as accurately as possible his gait and
carriage, I get the most curious impression of feeling as the person himself

due to the arousing of associational trains which reverberate. A flavor
may fairly shake us by the ghosts of 'banquet halls deserted,' which it suddenly
calls up; or a smell may make us feel almost sick with the waft it
brings over our memory of 'gardens that are ruins, and pleasure-houses that
are dust.' "In the Pyrenees," says M. Guyau, "after a summer-day's tramp
carried to the extreme of fatigue, I met a shepherd and asked him for some
milk. He went to fetch from his hut, under which a brook ran, a jar of
milk plunged in the water and kept at a coldness which was almost icy.
In drinking this fresh milk <i>into which all the mountain had put its perfume</i>,
and of which each savory swallow seemed to give new life, I certainly experienced
a series of feelings which the word <i>agreeable</i> is insufficient to
designate. It was like a pastoral symphony, apprehended by the taste instead
of by the ear" (quoted by F. Paulhan from 'Les Problèmes de l'Æsthétique
Contemporaine,' p. 63).&mdash;Compare the dithyrambic about whiskey
of Col. R. Ingersoll, to which the presidential campaign of 1888 gave such
notoriety: "I send you some of the most wonderful whiskey that ever
drove the skeleton from a feast or painted landscapes in the brain of man.
It is the mingled souls of wheat and corn. In it you will find the sunshine
and shadow that chase each other over the billowy fields, the breath of
June, the carol of the lark, the dews of the night, the wealth of summer,
and autumn's rich content&mdash;all golden with imprisoned light. Drink it,
and you will hear the voice of men and maidens singing the 'Harvest
Home,' mingled with the laughter of children. Drink it, and you will feel
within your blood the star-lit dawns, the dreamy, tawny dusks of many
perfect days. For forty years this liquid joy has been within the happy
staves of oak, longing to touch the lips of man."&mdash;It is in this way that I
should reply to Mr. Gurney's criticism on my theory. My "view," this
writer says (Mind, ix. 425), "goes far to confound the two things which in
my opinion it is the prime necessity of musical psychology to distinguish&mdash;the
effect chiefly sensuous of mere streams or masses of finely colored
sound, and the distinctive musical emotion to which <i>the form</i> of a sequence
of sound, its melodic and harmonic individuality, even realized in complete
silence, is the vital and essential object. It is with the former of these two
very different things that the physical reactions, the stirring of the hair&mdash;the
tingling and the shiver&mdash;are by far most markedly connected.... If I
may speak of myself, there is plenty of music from which I have received
as much emotion in silent representation as when presented by the finest
orchestra; but it is with the latter condition that I almost exclusively associate
the cutaneous tingling and hair-stirring. But to call my enjoyment
of the <i>form</i>, of the <i>note-after-note</i>ness of a melody a mere critical 'judgment
of right' [see below, <a href="#Page_473">p. 473</a>] would really be to deny to me the power of
expressing a fact of simple and intimate expression in English. It is quintessentially
emotion.... Now there are hundreds of other bits of music ... which
I judge to be <i>right</i> without receiving an iota of the emotion.
For purposes of emotion they are to me like geometrical demonstrations or
like acts of integrity performed in Peru." The Beethoven-rightness of which
Gurney then goes on to speak, as something different from the Clementi-rightness
(even when the respective pieces are only heard in idea), is probably
a purely <i>auditory-sensational</i> thing. The Clementi-rightness also;
only, for reasons impossible to assign, the Clementi form does not give the
same sort of purely auditory satisfaction as the Beethoven form, and might
better be described perhaps negatively as <i>non-wrong</i>, i.e., free from positively
unpleasant acoustic quality. In organizations as musical as Mr.
Gurney's, purely acoustic form gives so intense a degree of sensible pleasure
that the lower bodily reverberation is of no account. But I repeat that
I see nothing in the facts which Mr. Gurney cites, to lead one to believe
in an emotion divorced from <i>sensational processes</i> of any kind.</p></div>

of novelty, wonder, rapture of freedom, sense of power, hardly
survive any repetition of the experience. But as the text goes on to explain,
and as Goethe as quoted by Prof. Höffding says, this is because "the
soul is inwardly grown larger without knowing it, and can no longer be
filled by that first sensation. The man thinks that he has lost, but really he
has gained. What he has lost in rapture, he has gained in inward growth."
"It is," as Prof. Höffding himself adds, in a beautiful figure of speech,
"with our virgin feelings, as with the first breath drawn by the new-born
child, in which the lung expands itself so that it can never be emptied to
the same degree again. No later breath can feel just like that first one." On
this whole subject of emotional blunting, compare Höffding's Psychologie,
vi. E., and Bain's Emotions and Will, chapter iv. of the first part.</p></div>

(Les Phénomènes Affectifs et les Lois de leur Apparition), seems to me
rather to turn the truth upside down by his formula that emotions are due
to an inhibition of impulsive tendencies. <i>One</i> kind of emotion, namely,
uneasiness, annoyance, distress, does occur when any definite impulsive
tendency is checked, and all of M. P.'s illustrations are drawn from this
sort. The other emotions are themselves primary impulsive tendencies, of
a diffusive sort (involving, as M. P. rightly says, a <i>multiplicité des phénomènes</i>);
and just in proportion as more and more of these multiple tendencies
are checked, and replaced by some few narrow forms of discharge,
does the original emotion tend to disappear.</p></div>

is of grief, which would account (on Darwin's principles) for the frown of
anger. Mr. Spencer has an account of the angry frown as having arisen
through the survival of the fittest, by its utility in keeping the sun out of
one's eyes when engaged in mortal combat(!). (Principles of Psychology, ii.
546.) Professor Mosso objects to any explanation of the frown by its
utility for vision, that it is coupled, during emotional excitement, with
a dilatation of the pupil which is very unfavorable for distinct vision, and
that this ought to have been weeded out by natural selection, if natural
selection had the power to fix the frown (see La Paura, chap. ix. § vi).
Unfortunately this very able author speaks as if all the emotions affected
the pupil in the same way. Fear certainly does make it dilate. But
Gratiolet is quoted by Darwin and others as saying that the pupils <i>contract</i>
in anger. I have made no observations of my own on the point, and
Mosso's earlier paper on the pupil (Turin, 1875) I have not seen. I must
repeat, with Darwin, that we need more minute observations on this
subject.</p></div>

<h4>WILL.</h4>


<p>Desire, wish, will, are states of mind which everyone
knows, and which no definition can make plainer. We desire
to feel, to have, to do, all sorts of things which at the
moment are not felt, had, or done. If with the desire there
goes a sense that attainment is not possible, we simply <i>wish</i>;
but if we believe that the end is in our power, we <i>will</i> that
the desired feeling, having, or doing shall be real; and real
it presently becomes, either immediately upon the willing
or after certain preliminaries have been fulfilled.</p>

<p>The only ends which follow <i>immediately</i> upon our willing
seem to be movements of our own bodies. Whatever
<i>feelings</i> and <i>havings</i> we may will to get, come in as results
of preliminary movements which we make for the purpose.
This fact is too familiar to need illustration; so that we may
start with the proposition that the only <i>direct</i> outward
effects of our will are bodily movements. The mechanism
of production of these voluntary movements is what befalls
us to study now. The subject involves a good many separate
points which it is difficult to arrange in any continuous
logical order. I will treat of them successively in the
mere order of convenience; trusting that at the end the
reader will gain a clear and connected view.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The movements we have studied hitherto have been
automatic and reflex, and (on the first occasion of their performance,
at any rate) unforeseen by the agent. The movements
to the study of which we now address ourselves,
being desired and intended beforehand, are of course done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
with full prevision of what they are to be. It follows from
this that <i>voluntary movements must be secondary, not primary
functions of our organism.</i> This is the first point to understand
in the psychology of Volition. Reflex, instinctive,
and emotional movements are all primary performances.
The nerve-centres are so organized that certain stimuli pull
the trigger of certain explosive parts; and a creature going
through one of these explosions for the first time undergoes
an entirely novel experience. The other day I was
standing at a railroad station with a little child, when an
express-train went thundering by. The child, who was
near the edge of the platform, started, winked, had his
breathing convulsed, turned pale, burst out crying, and ran
frantically towards me and hid his face. I have no doubt
that this youngster was almost as much astonished by his
own behavior as he was by the train, and more than I was,
who stood by. Of course if such a reaction has many times
occurred we learn what to expect of ourselves, and can then
foresee our conduct, even though it remain as involuntary
and uncontrollable as it was before. But if, in voluntary
action properly so-called, the act must be foreseen, it follows
that no creature not endowed with divinatory power
can perform an act voluntarily for the first time. Well, we
are no more endowed with prophetic vision of what movements
lie in our power, than we are endowed with prophetic
vision of what sensations we are capable of receiving.
As we must wait for the sensations to be given us, so we
must wait for the movements to be performed involuntarily,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
before we can frame ideas of what either of
these things are. We learn all our possibilities by the
way of experience. When a particular movement, having
once occurred in a random, reflex, or involuntary way, has
left an image of itself in the memory, then the movement
can be desired again, proposed as an end, and deliberately
willed. But it is impossible to see how it could be willed
before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span></p>
<p><i>A supply of ideas of the various movements that are possible
left in the memory by experiences of their involuntary performance
is thus the first prerequisite of the voluntary life.</i></p>

<p>Now the same movement involuntarily performed may
leave many different kinds of ideas of itself in the memory.
If performed by another person, we of course <i>see</i> it, or we
<i>feel</i> it if the moving part strikes another part of our own
body. Similarly we have an auditory image of its effects
if it produces sounds, as for example when it is one of the
movements made in vocalization, or in playing on a musical
instrument. All these <i>remote</i> effects of the movement, as
we may call them, are also produced by movements which
we ourselves perform; and they leave innumerable ideas
in our mind by which we distinguish each movement
from the rest. It <i>looks</i> distinct; it <i>feels</i> distinct to some
distant part of the body which it strikes; or it <i>sounds</i> distinct.
These remote effects would then, rigorously speaking,
suffice to furnish the mind with the supply of ideas
required.</p>

<p>But in addition to these impressions upon remote organs
of sense, we have, whenever we perform a movement
ourselves, another set of impressions, those, namely, which
come up from the parts that are actually moved. These
<i>kinæsthetic</i> impressions, as Dr. Bastian has called them, are
so many <i>resident</i> effects of the motion. Not only are our
muscles supplied with afferent as well as with efferent
nerves, but the tendons, the ligaments, the articular surfaces,
and the skin about the joints are all sensitive, and,
being stretched and squeezed in ways characteristic of each
particular movement, give us as many distinctive feelings
as there are movements possible to perform.</p>

<p>It is by these resident impressions that we are made
conscious of <i>passive movements</i>&mdash;movements communicated
to our limbs by others. If you lie with closed eyes, and
another person noiselessly places your arm or leg in any
arbitrarily chosen attitude, you receive an accurate feeling
of what attitude it is, and can immediately reproduce it
yourself in the arm or leg of the opposite side. Similarly
a man waked suddenly from sleep in the dark is aware of
how he finds himself lying. At least this is what happens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
when the nervous apparatus is normal. But in cases of
disease we sometimes find that the resident impressions do
not normally excite the centres, and that then the sense of
attitude is lost. It is only recently that pathologists have
begun to study these anæsthesias with the delicacy which
they require; and we have doubtless yet a great deal to
learn about them. The skin may be anæsthetic, and the
muscles may not feel the cramp-like pain which is produced
by faradic currents sent through them, and yet the
sense of passive movement may be retained. It seems, in
fact, to persist more obstinately than the other forms of
sensibility, for cases are comparatively common in which
all the other feelings in the limb but this one of attitude are
lost. In <a href="#CHAPTER_XX">Chapter XX</a> I have tried to make it appear that
the articular surfaces are probably the most important
source of the resident kinæsthetic feelings. But the
determination of their special organ is indifferent to our
present quest. It is enough to know that the existence
of these feelings cannot be denied.</p>

<p>When the feelings of passive movement as well as all
the other feelings of a limb are lost, we get such results as
are given in the following account by Professor A. Strümpell
of his wonderful anæsthetic boy, whose only sources of
feeling were the right eye and the left ear:<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Passive movements could be imprinted on all the extremities to the
greatest extent, without attracting the patient's notice. Only in
violent forced hyperextension of the joints, especially of the knees,
there arose a dull vague feeling of strain, but this was seldom precisely
localized. We have often, after bandaging the eyes of the patient,
carried him about the room, laid him on a table, given to his arms and
legs the most fantastic and apparently the most inconvenient attitudes,
without his having a suspicion of it. The expression of astonishment
in his face, when all at once the removal of the handkerchief revealed
his situation, is indescribable in words. Only when his head was made
to hang away down he immediately spoke of dizziness, but could not
assign its ground. Later he sometimes inferred from the sounds connected
with the manipulation that something special was being done
with him.... He had no feelings of muscular fatigue. If, with his
eyes shut, we told him to raise his arm and to keep it up, he did so
without trouble. After one or two minutes, however, the arm began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
tremble and sink without his being aware of it. He asserted still his
ability to keep it up.... Passively holding still his fingers did not
affect him. He thought constantly that he opened and shut his hand,
whereas it was really fixed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Or we read of cases like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Voluntary movements cannot be estimated the moment the patient
ceases to take note of them by his eyes. Thus, after having made him
close his eyes, if one asks him to move one of his limbs either wholly or
in part, he does it but cannot tell whether the effected movement is
large or small, strong or weak, or even if it has taken place at all. And
when he opens his eyes after moving his leg from right to left, for
example, he declares that he had a very inexact notion of the extent of
the effected movement.... If, having the intention of executing a
certain movement, <i>I prevent him,</i> he does not perceive it, and supposes
the limb to have taken the position he intended to give it."<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Or this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The patient, when his eyes were closed in the middle of an
unpractised movement, remained with the extremity in the position it
had when the eyes closed and did not complete the movement properly.
Then after some oscillations the limb gradually sank by reason of its
weight (the sense of fatigue being absent). Of this the patient was not
aware, and wondered, when he opened his eyes, at the altered position
of his limb."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A similar condition can be readily reproduced experimentally
in many hypnotic subjects. All that is needed is
to tell a suitably predisposed person during the hypnotic
trance that he cannot feel his limb, and he will be quite
unaware of the attitudes into which you may throw it.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>All these cases, whether spontaneous or experimental,
show the absolute need of <i>guiding sensations</i> of some kind
for the successful carrying out of a concatenated series of
movements. It is, in fact, easy to see that, just as where the
chain of movements is automatic (see above, Vol. I. p. 116),
each later movement of the chain has to be discharged by
the impression which the next earlier one makes in being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
executed, so also, where the chain is voluntary, we need to
know at each movement just <i>where we are in it,</i> if we are to
will intelligently what the next link shall be. A man with
no feeling of his movements might lead off never so well,
and yet be sure to get lost soon and go astray.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> But
patients like those described, who get no kinæsthetic
impressions, can still be guided by the sense of sight.
Thus Strümpell says of his boy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One could always observe how his eye was directed first to the
object held before him, then to his own arm; and how it never ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
to follow the latter during its entire movement. All his voluntary
movements took place under the unremitting lead of the eye, which as
an indispensable guide, was never untrue to its functions."</p></blockquote>

<p>So in the Landry case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With his eyes open, he easily opposes the thumb to each of the
other fingers; with his eyes closed, the movement of opposition occurs,
but the thumb only by chance meets the finger which it seeks. With
his eyes open he is able, without hesitation, to bring his two hands
together; but when his eyes are closed his hands seek one another in
space, and only meet by chance."</p></blockquote>

<p>In Charles Bell's well-known old case of anæsthesia the
woman could only hold her baby safely in her arms so long
as she looked at it. I have myself reproduced a similar
condition in two hypnotic subjects whose arm and hand
were made anæsthetic without being paralyzed. They could
write their names when looking, but not when their eyes
were closed. The modern mode of teaching deaf mutes to
articulate consists in making them attentive to certain
laryngeal, labial, thoracic, and other sensations, the reproduction
of which becomes a guide to their vocalization.
Normally it is the remoter sensations which we receive by
the ear which keep us from going astray in our speech.
The phenomena of aphasia show this to be the usual case.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>This is perhaps all that need be said about the existence
of passive sensations of movement and their indispensableness
for our voluntary activity. We may consequently set
it down as certain that, <i>whether or no there be anything else in
the mind at the moment when we consciously will a certain act,
a mental conception made up of memory-images of these sensations,
defining which special act it is, must be there.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now <i>is there anything else in the mind when we will to do an
act?</i> We must proceed in this chapter from the simpler to
the more complicated cases. My first thesis accordingly is,
that <i>there need be nothing else</i>, and that <i>in perfectly simple</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
<i>voluntary acts there is nothing else, in the mind but the kinæsthetic
idea, thus defined, of what the act is to be.</i></p>

<p>A powerful tradition in Psychology will have it that
something additional to these images of passive sensation
is essential to the mental determination of a voluntary act.
There must, of course, be a special current of energy going
out from the brain into the appropriate muscles during the
act; and this outgoing current (it is supposed) must have
in each particular case a feeling <i>sui generis</i> attached to it, or
else (it is said) the mind could never tell which particular
current, the current to this muscle or the current to that one,
was the right one to use. This feeling of the current of outgoing
energy has received from Wundt the name of the
<i>feeling of innervation. I disbelieve in its existence,</i> and must
proceed to criticise the notion of it, at what I fear may to
some prove tedious length.</p>

<p>At first sight there is something extremely plausible in
the feeling of innervation. The passive feelings of movement
with which we have hitherto been dealing all come
after the movement's performance. But wherever a movement
is difficult and precise, we become, as a matter of fact,
acutely aware <i>in advance</i> of the amount and direction of
energy which it is to involve. One has only to play tenpins
or billiards, or throw a ball, to catch his will in the
act, as it were, of balancing tentatively its possible efforts,
and ideally rehearsing various muscular contractions nearly
correct, until it gets just the right one before it, when it
says 'Now go!' This premonitory weighing feels so much
like a succession of tentative sallyings forth of power into
the outer world, followed by correction just in time to avoid
the irrevocable deed, that the notion that <i>outgoing</i> nerve-currents
rather than mere vestiges of former passive sensibility
accompany it, is a most natural one to entertain.</p>

<p>We find accordingly that most authors have taken the
existence of feelings of innervation as a matter of course.
Bain, Wundt, Helmholtz, and Mach defend them most
explicitly. But in spite of the authority which such writers
deservedly wield, I cannot help thinking that they are in
this instance wrong,&mdash;that the discharge into the motor
nerves is insentient, and that <i>all our ideas of movement</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
including those of the effort which it requires, as well as those
of its direction, its extent, its strength, and its velocity, <i>are
images of peripheral sensations, either 'remote,' or resident in
the moving parts, or in other parts which sympathetically act
with them in consequence of the 'diffusive wave.'</i></p>

<p><i>A priori</i>, as I shall show, there is no reason why there
should be a consciousness of the motor discharge, and there
is a reason why there should not be such a consciousness.
The <i>presumption</i> is thus against the existence of the feeling
of innervation; and the burden of proving it falls upon those
who believe in it. If the positive empirical evidence which
they offer prove also insufficient, then their case falls to the
ground, and the feeling in question must be ruled out of
court.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the first place, then, let me show that <i>the assumption
of the feeling of innervation is unnecessary.</i></p>

<p>I cannot help suspecting that the scholastic prejudice
that 'the effect must be already in some way <i>contained in</i> the
cause' has had something to do with making psychologists
so ready to admit the feeling of innervation. The outgoing
current being the effect, what psychic antecedent could
contain or prefigure it better than a feeling of it? But
if we take a wide view, and consider the psychic antecedents
of our activities at large, we see that the scholastic
maxim breaks down everywhere, and that its verification
in this instance would rather violate than illustrate the
general rule. In the diffusive wave, in reflex action, and
in emotional expression, the movements which are the
effects are in no manner contained by anticipation in the
stimuli which are their cause. The latter are subjective
sensations or objective perceptions, which do not in the
slightest degree resemble or prefigure the movements. But
we get them, and, presto! there the movements are! They
are knocked out of us, they surprise us. It is just cause
for wonder, as our chapter on Instinct has shown us,
that such bodily consequences should follow such mental
antecedents. We explain the mystery <i>tant bien que
mal</i> by our evolutionary theories, saying that lucky variations
and heredity have gradually brought it about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
this particular pair of terms should have grown into a uniform
sequence. Meanwhile why any state of consciousness
<i>at all</i> should precede a movement, we know not&mdash;the two
things seem so essentially discontinuous. But if a state of
consciousness there must be, why then it may, for aught
we can see, as easily be one sort of a state as another. It
is swallowing a camel and straining at a gnat for a man (all
of whose muscles will on certain occasions contract at a
sudden touch or sound) to suppose that on another occasion
the idea of the feelings about to be produced by their contraction
is an insufficient mental signal for the latter, and to
insist that an additional antecedent is needed in the shape
of 'a feeling of the outgoing discharge.'</p>

<p>No! for aught we can see, and in the light of general
analogy, the kinæsthetic ideas, as we have defined them, or
images of incoming feelings of attitude and motion, are as
<i>likely</i> as any feelings of innervation are, to be the last
psychic antecedents and determiners of the various currents
downwards into the muscles from the brain. The
question "What <i>are</i> the antecedents and determinants?" is
a question of fact, to be decided by whatever empirical evidence
may be found.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>
<p>But before considering the empirical evidence, let me
go on to show that there is <i>a certain a priori reason why
the kinæsthetic images</i> <span class="smcap">ought</span> <i>to be the last psychic antecedents of
the outgoing currents, and why we should expect these currents
to be insentient; why, in short, the soi-disant feelings of innervation
should</i> <span class="smcap">not</span> <i>exist</i>.</p>

<p>It is a general principle in Psychology that consciousness
deserts all processes where it can no longer be of use.
The tendency of consciousness to a minimum of complication
is in fact a dominating law. The law of parsimony in
logic is only its best known case. We grow unconscious
of every feeling which is useless as a sign to lead us to our
ends, and where one sign will suffice others drop out, and
that one remains, to work alone. We observe this in the
whole history of sense-perception, and in the acquisition
of every art. We ignore which eye we see with, because a
fixed mechanical association has been formed between our
motions and each retinal image. Our motions are the
ends of our seeing, our retinal images the signals to these
ends. If each retinal image, whichever it be, can suggest
automatically a motion in the right direction, what need
for us to know whether it be in the right eye or the left?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
That knowledge would be superfluous complication. So in
acquiring any art or voluntary function. The marksman
ends by thinking only of the exact position of the goal, the
singer only of the perfect sound, the balancer only of the
point of the pole whose oscillations he must counteract.
The associated mechanism has become so perfect in all
these persons that each variation in the thought of the
end is functionally correlated with the one movement
fitted to bring the latter about. Whilst they were tyros,
they thought of their means as well as their end: the
marksman of the position of his gun or bow, or the weight
of his stone; the pianist of the visible position of the note
on the keyboard; the singer of his throat or breathing; the
balancer of his feet on the rope, or his hand or chin under
the pole. But little by little they succeeded in dropping
all this supernumerary consciousness, and they became
secure in their movements exactly in proportion as they
did so.</p>

<p>Now if we analyze the nervous mechanism of voluntary
action, we shall see that by virtue of this principle of parsimony
in consciousness the motor discharge <i>ought</i> to be
devoid of sentience. If we call the immediate psychic antecedent
of a movement the latter's <i>mental cue</i>, all that is
needed for invariability of sequence on the movement's
part is a <i>fixed connection</i> between each several mental cue,
and one particular movement. For a movement to be produced
with perfect precision, it suffices that it obey instantly
its own mental cue and nothing else, and that this
mental cue be incapable of awakening any other movement.
Now the <i>simplest</i> possible arrangement for producing voluntary
movements would be that the memory-images of
the movement's distinctive peripheral effects, whether resident
or remote,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> themselves should severally constitute the
mental cues, and that no other psychic facts should intervene
or be mixed up with them. For a million different
voluntary movements, we should then need a million distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
processes in the brain-cortex (each corresponding to
the idea or memory-image of one movement), and a million
distinct paths of discharge. Everything would then be
unambiguously determined, and if the idea were right, the
movement-would be right too. Everything <i>after</i> the idea
might then be quite insentient, and the motor discharge
itself could be unconsciously performed.</p>

<p>The partisans of the feeling of innervation, however,
say that the motor discharge itself must be felt, and that
it, and not the idea of the movement's distinctive effects,
must be the proper mental cue. Thus the principle of
parsimony is sacrificed, and all economy and simplicity are
lost. For what can be gained by the interposition of this
relay of feeling between the idea of the movement and the
movement? Nothing on the score of economy of nerve-tracts;
for it takes just as many of them to associate a
million ideas of movement with a million motor centres,
each with a specific feeling of innervation attached to its
discharge, as to associate the same million ideas with a
million insentient motor centres. And nothing on the score
of precision; for the only conceivable way in which the
feelings of innervation might further precision would be by
giving to a mind whose idea of a movement was vague, a sort
of halting stage with sharper imagery on which to collect
its wits before uttering its <i>fiat</i>. But not only are the conscious
discriminations between our kinæsthetic ideas much
sharper than any one pretends the shades of difference between
feelings of innervation to be, but even were this not
the case, it is impossible to see how a mind with its idea
vaguely conceived could tell out of a lot of <i>Innervationsgefühle</i>,
were they never so sharply differentiated, which one
fitted that idea exactly, and which did not. A sharply conceived
idea will, on the other hand, <i>directly</i> awaken a distinct
movement as easily as it will awaken a distinct feeling
of innervation. If feelings can go astray through vagueness,
surely the fewer steps of feeling there are interposed
the more securely we shall act. We ought then, on <i>a
priori</i> grounds alone, to regard the <i>Innervationsgefühl</i> as
a pure encumbrance, and to presume that the peripheral
ideas of movement are sufficient mental cues.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span></p>
<p>The presumption being thus against the feelings of innervation,
those who defend their existence are bound to
prove it by positive evidence. The evidence might be direct
or indirect. If we could introspectively feel them as
something plainly distinct from the peripheral feelings and
ideas of movement which nobody denies to be there, that
would be evidence both direct and conclusive. Unfortunately
it does not exist.</p>

<p><i>There is no introspective evidence of the feeling of innervation.</i>
Wherever we look for it and think we have grasped
it, we find that we have really got a peripheral feeling or
image instead&mdash;an image of the way in which we feel when
the innervation is over, and the movement is in process of
doing or is done. Our idea of raising our arm, for example,
or of crooking our finger, is a sense, more or less vivid, of
how the raised arm or the crooked finger feels. There is
no other mental material out of which such an idea might
be made. We cannot possibly have any idea of our ears'
motion until our ears have moved; and this is true of every
other organ as well.</p>

<p>Since the time of Hume it has been a commonplace in
psychology that we are only conversant with the outward
results of our volition, and not with the hidden inner
machinery of nerves and muscles which are what it primarily
sets at work.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> The believers in the feeling of innervation
readily admit this, but seem hardly alive to its consequences.
It seems to me that one immediate consequence
ought to be to make us doubt the existence of the
feeling in dispute. Whoever says that in raising his arm
he is ignorant of how many muscles he contracts, in what
order of sequence, and in what degrees of intensity, expressively
avows a colossal amount of unconsciousness of
the processes of motor discharge. Each separate muscle
at any rate cannot have its distinct feeling of innervation.
Wundt,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> who makes such enormous use of these hypothetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
feelings in his psychologic construction of space, is
himself led to admit that they have no differences of quality,
but feel alike in all muscles, and vary only in their degrees
of intensity. They are used by the mind as guides, not
of <i>which</i> movement, but of <i>how strong</i> a movement, it is
making, or shall make. But does not this virtually surrender
their existence altogether?<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>For if anything be obvious to introspection it is that
the degree of strength of our muscular contractions is completely
revealed to us by afferent feelings coming from the
muscles themselves and their insertions, from the vicinity
of the joints, and from the general fixation of the larynx,
chest, face, and body, in the phenomenon of effort, objectively
considered. When a certain degree of energy of contraction
rather than another is thought of by us, this complex
aggregate of afferent feelings, forming the material of
our thought, renders absolutely precise and distinctive our
mental image of the exact strength of movement to be
made, and the exact amount of resistance to be overcome.</p>

<p>Let the reader try to direct his will towards a particular
movement, and then notice what <i>constituted</i> the direction
of the will. Was it anything over and above the notion
of the different feelings to which the movement when
effected would give rise? If we abstract from these feelings,
will any sign, principle, or means of orientation be
left by which the will may innervate the right muscles
with the right intensity, and not go astray into the wrong
ones? Strip off these images of result, and so far from
leaving us with a complete assortment of directions into
which our will may launch itself, you leave our consciousness
in an absolute and total vacuum. If I will to write
"Peter" rather than "Paul," it is the thought of certain
digital sensations, of certain alphabetic sounds, of certain
appearances on the paper, and of no others, which immediately
precedes the motion of my pen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span></p>
<p>If I will to utter the word <i>Paul</i> rather than <i>Peter</i>, it is
the thought of my voice falling on my ear, and of certain
muscular feelings in my tongue, lips, and larynx, which
guide the utterance. All these are incoming feelings, and
between the thought of them, by which the act is mentally
specified with all possible completeness, and the act itself,
there is no room for any third order of mental phenomenon.
There is indeed the <i>fiat</i>, the element of consent,
or resolve that the act shall ensue. This, doubtless, to
the reader's mind, as to my own, constitutes the essence of
the voluntariness of the act. This <i>fiat</i> will be treated of
in detail farther on. It may be entirely neglected here,
for it is a constant coefficient, affecting all voluntary
actions alike, and incapable of serving to distinguish them.
No one will pretend that its quality varies according as the
right arm, for example, or the left is used.</p>

<p><i>An anticipatory image, then, of the sensorial consequences
of a movement, plus (on certain occasions) the fiat that these
consequences shall become actual, is the only psychic state
which introspection lets us discern as the forerunner of our
voluntary acts.</i> There is no introspective evidence whatever
of any still later or concomitant feeling attached to
the efferent discharge. The various degrees of difficulty with
which the fiat is given form a complication of the utmost
importance, to be discussed farther on.</p>

<p>Now the reader may still shake his head and say:
"But can you seriously mean that all the wonderfully
exact adjustment of my action's strength to its ends is not
a matter of outgoing innervation? Here is a cannon-ball,
and here a pasteboard box: instantly and accurately I
lift each from the table, the ball not refusing to rise
because my innervation was too weak, the box not flying
abruptly into the air because it was too strong. Could
representations of the movement's different sensory effects
in the two cases be so delicately foreshadowed in the
mind? or being there, is it credible that they should,
all unaided, so delicately graduate the stimulation of the
unconscious motor centres to their work?" Even so!
I reply to both queries. We have a most extremely delicate
foreshadowing of the sensory effects. Why else the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
start of surprise that runs through us if some one has
filled the light-seeming box with sand before we try to
lift it, or has substituted for the cannon-ball which we
know a painted wooden imitation? <i>Surprise</i> can only
come from getting a sensation which differs from the one
we expect. But the truth is that when we know the objects
well, the very slightest difference from the expected weight
will surprise us, or at least attract our notice. With unknown
objects we begin by expecting the weight made
probable by their appearance. The expectation of this
sensation innervates our lift, and we 'set' it rather small
at first. An instant verifies whether it is too small. Our
expectation rises, i.e., we think in a twinkling of a setting
of the chest and teeth, a bracing of the back, and a more
violent feeling in the arms. Quicker than thought we have
them, and with them the burden ascends into the air.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
Bernhardt<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> has shown in a rough experimental way that
our estimation of the amount of a resistance is as delicately
graduated when our wills are passive, and our limbs made
to contract by direct local faradization, as when we ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
innervate them. Ferrier<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> has repeated and verified
the observations. They admit of no great precision, and
too much stress should not be laid upon them either way;
but at the very least they tend to show that no added delicacy
would accrue to our perception from the consciousness
of the efferent process, even if it existed.</p>

<p>Since there is no direct introspective evidence for the
feelings of innervation, is there any indirect or circumstantial
evidence? Much is offered; but on critical examination
it breaks down. Let us see what it is. Wundt says
that were our motor feelings of an afferent nature,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"it ought to be expected that they would increase and diminish with
the amount of outer or inner work actually effected in contraction.
This, however, is not the case, but the strength of the motor sensation
is purely proportional to the strength of the <i>impulse</i> to movement,
which starts from the central organ innervating the motor nerves.
This may be proved by observations made by physicians in cases of
morbid alteration in the muscular effect. A patient whose arm or leg
is half paralyzed, so that he can only move the limb with great effort,
has a distinct feeling of this effort: the limb seems to him heavier than
before, appearing as if weighted with lead; he has, therefore, a sense
of more work effected than formerly, and yet the effected work is either
the same or even less. Only he must, to get even this effect, exert a
stronger innervation, a stronger motor impulse, than formerly."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In complete paralysis, also, patients will be conscious
of putting forth the greatest exertion to move a limb which
remains absolutely still upon the bed, and from which of
course no afferent muscular or other feelings can come.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>But Dr. Ferrier in his Functions of the Brain (Am. Ed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
pp. 222-4) disposes very easily of this line of argument.
He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is necessary, however, to exclude movements <i>altogether</i> before
such an explanation [as Wundt's] can be adopted. Now, though the
hemiplegic patient cannot move his paralyzed limb, though he is conscious
of trying hard, yet he will be found to be making powerful muscular
exertion of some kind. Vulpian has called attention to the fact,
and I have repeatedly verified it, that when a hemiplegic patient is
desired to close his paralyzed fist, in his endeavors to do so he unconsciously
performs this action with the sound one. It is, in fact, almost
impossible to exclude such a source of complication, and unless this is
taken into account very erroneous conclusions as to the cause of the
sense of effort may be drawn. In the fact of muscular contraction and
the concomitant centripetal impressions, even though the action is not
such as is desired, the conditions of the consciousness of effort exist
without our being obliged to regard it as depending on central innervation
or outgoing currents.</p>

<p>"It is, however, easy to make an experiment of a simple nature
which will satisfactorily account for the sense of effort, even when these
unconscious contractions of the other side, such as hemiplegics make,
are entirely excluded.</p>

<p>"If the reader will extend his right arm and hold his forefinger in
the position required for pulling the trigger of a pistol, he may without
actually moving his finger, but by simply making believe, experience a
consciousness of energy put forth. Here, then, is a clear case of consciousness
of energy without actual contraction of the muscles either of
the one hand or the other, and without any perceptible bodily strain.
If the reader will again perform the experiment, and pay careful attention
to the condition of his respiration, he will observe that his consciousness
of effort coincides with a fixation of the muscles of his chest,
and that in proportion to the amount of energy he feels he is putting
forth, he is keeping his glottis closed and actively contracting his respiratory
muscles. Let him place his finger as before, and <i>continue
breathing</i> all the time, and he will find that however much he may
direct his attention to his finger, he will experience not the slightest
trace of consciousness of effort until he has actually moved the finger
itself, and then it is referred locally to the muscles in action. It is only
when this essential and ever-present respiratory factor is, as it has been,
overlooked, that the consciousness of effort can with any degree of
plausibility be ascribed to the outgoing current. In the contraction of
the respiratory muscles there are the necessary conditions of centripetal
impressions, and these are capable of originating the general sense of
effort. When these active efforts are withheld, no consciousness of
effort ever arises, except in so far as it is conditioned by the local contraction
of the group of muscles towards which the attention is directed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
or by other muscular contractions called unconsciously into play in the
attempt.</p>

<p>"I am unable to find a single case of consciousness of effort which
is not explicable in one or other of the ways specified. In all instances
the consciousness of effort is conditioned by the actual fact of muscular
contraction. That it is dependent on centripetal impressions generated
by the act of contraction, I have already endeavored to show. When
the paths of the centripetal impressions or the cerebral centres of the
same are destroyed, there is no vestige of a muscular sense. That the
central organs for the apprehension of the impressions originating from
muscular contraction are different from those which send out the motor
impulse, has already been established. But when Wundt argues that
this cannot be so, because then the sensation would always keep pace
with the energy of muscular contraction, he overlooks the important
factor of the fixation of the respiratory muscles, which is the basis of
the general sense of effort in all its varying degrees."</p></blockquote>

<p>To these remarks of Ferrier's I have nothing to add.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
Any one may verify them, and they prove conclusively that
the consciousness of muscular exertion, being impossible
without movement <i>effected somewhere</i>, must be an afferent
and not an efferent sensation; a consequence, and not an
antecedent, of the movement itself. An idea of the amount
of muscular exertion requisite to perform a certain movement
can consequently be nothing other than an anticipatory
image of the movement's sensible effects.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span></p>
<p>Driven thus from the body at large, where next shall the
circumstantial evidence for the feeling of innervation lodge
itself? Where but in the muscles of the eye, from which
small retreat it judges itself inexpugnable. Nevertheless,
that fastness too must fall, and by the lightest of bombardments.
But, before trying the bombardment, let us
recall our general principles about optical vertigo, or illusory
appearance of movement in objects.</p>

<p>We judge that an object moves under two distinct sets
of circumstances:</p>

<p>1. When its image moves on the retina, and we know
that the eye is still.</p>

<p>2. When its image is stationary on the retina, and we
know that the eye is moving. In this case we feel that we
<i>follow</i> the object.</p>

<p>In either of these cases a mistaken judgment about the
state of the eye will produce optical vertigo.</p>

<p>If in case 1 we think our eye is still when it is really
moving, we get a movement of the retinal image which
we judge to be due to a real outward motion of the
object. This is what happens after looking at rushing
water, or through the windows of a moving railroad car, or
after turning on one's heel to giddiness. The eyes, without
our intending to move them, go through a series of involuntary
rotations, continuing those they were previously
obliged to make to keep objects in view. If the objects had
been whirling by to our right, our eyes when turned to
stationary objects will still move slowly towards the right.
The retinal image upon them will then move like that of an
object passing to the left. We then try to catch it by voluntarily
and rapidly rotating the eyes to the left, when the
involuntary impulse again rotates the eyes to the right, continuing
the apparent motion; and so the game goes on.
(See above, <a href="#Page_89">pp. 89-91</a>.)</p>

<p>If in case 2 we think our eyes moving when they are in
reality still, we shall judge that we are following a moving
object when we are but fixating a steadfast one. Illusions
of this kind occur after sudden and complete paralysis of
special eye muscles, and the partisans of feelings of efferent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
innervation regard them as <i>experimenta crucis</i>. Helmholtz
writes:<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the external rectus muscle of the right eye, or its nerve, is
paralyzed, the eye can no longer be rotated to the right side. So long
as the patient turns it only to the nasal side it makes regular movements,
and he perceives correctly the position of objects in the visual
field. So soon, however, as he tries to rotate it outwardly, i.e., towards
the right, it ceases to obey his will, stands motionless in the middle of
its course, and the objects appear flying to the right, although position
of eye and retinal image are unaltered.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>"In such a case the exertion of the will is followed neither by actual
movement of the eye, nor by contraction of the muscle in question,
nor even by increased tension in it. The act of will <i>produced absolutely
no effect</i> beyond the nervous system, and yet we judge of the direction
of the line of vision as if the will had exercised its normal effects. We
believe it to have moved to the right, and since the retinal image is
unchanged, we attribute to the object the same movement we have erroneously
ascribed to the eye.... These phenomena leave no room
for doubt that we only judge the direction of the line of sight by the
effort of will with which we strive to change the position of our eyes.
There are also certain weak feelings in our eyelids,... and furthermore
in excessive lateral rotations we feel a fatiguing strain in the
muscles. But all these feelings are too faint and vague to be of use in
the perception of direction. We feel then what impulse of the will, and
how strong a one, we apply to turn our eye into a given position."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Partial</i> paralysis of the same muscle, <i>paresis</i>, as it has
been called, seems to point even more conclusively to the
same inference, that the will to innervate is felt independently
of all its afferent results. I will quote the account
given by a recent authority,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> of the effects of this accident:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the nerve going to an eye muscle, e.g., the external rectus
of one side, falls into a state of paresis, the first result is that the same
volitional stimulus, which under normal circumstances would have perhaps
rotated the eye to its extreme position outwards, now is competent
to effect only a moderate outward rotation, say of 20º. If now, shutting
the sound eye, the patient looks at an object situated just so far outwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
from the paretic eye that this latter must turn 20º in order to
see it distinctly, the patient will feel as if he had moved it not only 20º
towards the side, but into its extreme lateral position, for the impulse
of innervation requisite for bringing it into view is a perfectly conscious
act, whilst the diminished state of contraction of the paretic muscle lies
for the present out of the ken of consciousness. The test proposed by
von Graefe, of localization by the sense of touch, serves to render evident
the error which the patient now makes. If we direct him to touch
rapidly the object looked at, with the forefinger of the hand of the same
side, the line through which the finger moves will not be the line of
sight directed 20º outward, but will approach more nearly to the extreme
possible outward line of vision."</p></blockquote>

<p>A stone-cutter with the external rectus of the left eye
paralyzed, will strike his hand instead of his chisel with his
hammer, until experience has taught him wisdom.</p>

<p>It appears as if here the judgment of direction <i>could</i> only
arise from the excessive innervation of the rectus when the
object is looked at. All the afferent feelings must be identical
with those experienced when the eye is sound and the
judgment is correct. The eyeball is rotated just 20º in the
one case as in the other, the image falls on the same part
of the retina, the pressures on the eyeball and the tensions
of the skin and conjunctiva are identical. There is only
one feeling which <i>can</i> vary, and lead us to our mistake.
That feeling must be the effort which the will makes, moderate
in the one case, excessive in the other, but in both
cases an efferent feeling, pure and simple.</p>

<p>Beautiful and clear as this reasoning seems to be, it is
based on an incomplete inventory of the afferent data. The
writers have all omitted to consider what is going on in the
<i>other eye</i>. This is kept covered during the experiments, to
prevent double images, and other complications. But if its
condition under these circumstances be examined, it will
be found to present changes which must result in strong
afferent feelings. And the taking account of these feelings
demolishes in an instant all the conclusions which the authors
from whom I have quoted base upon their supposed
absence. This I will now proceed to show.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span></p>
<p>Take first the case of complete paralysis and assume the
right eye affected. Suppose the patient desires to rotate
his gaze to an object situated in the extreme right of the
field of vision. As Hering has so beautifully shown, both
eyes move by a common act of innervation, and in this
instance both move towards the right. But the paralyzed
right eye stops short in the middle of its course, the object
still appearing far to the sight of its fixation point. The
left sound eye, meanwhile, although covered, continues its
rotation until the extreme rightward limit thereof has been
reached. To an observer looking at both eyes the left will
seem to squint. Of course this continued and extreme rotation
produces afferent feelings of rightward motion in the
eyeball, which momentarily overpower the faint feelings
of central position in the diseased and uncovered eye. The
patient feels by his left eyeball as if he were following an
object which by his right retina he perceives he does not
overtake. All the conditions of optical vertigo are here
present: the image stationary on the retina, and the erroneous
conviction that the eyes are moving.</p>

<p>The objection that a feeling in the left eyeball ought not
to produce a conviction that the right eye moves, will be
considered in a moment. Let us meanwhile turn to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
case of simple paresis with apparent translocation of the
field.</p>

<p>Here the right eye succeeds in fixating the object, but
observation of the left eye will reveal to an observer the
fact that it squints just as violently inwards as in the former
case. The direction which the finger of the patient takes
in pointing to the object, is the direction of this squinting
and covered left eye. As Graefe says (although he fails to
seize the true import of his own observation), "It appears
to have been by no means sufficiently noticed how significantly
the direction of the line of sight of the secondarily
deviating eye [i.e., of the left,] and the line of direction of
the pointed finger agree."</p>

<p>The translocation would, in a word, be perfectly explained
could we suppose that the sensation of a certain
degree of rotation in the left eyeball were able to suggest
to the patient the position of an object whose image falls
on the right retina alone.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Can, then, a feeling in one eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
be confounded with a feeling in the other? It most assuredly
can, for not only Donders and Adamük, by their
vivisections, but Hering by his exquisite optical experiments,
have proved that the apparatus of innervation for both
eyes is single, and that they function as one organ&mdash;a
double eye, according to Hering, or what Helmholtz calls
a <i>Cyclopenauge</i>. The retinal feelings of this double organ,
singly innervated, are naturally undistinguished as respects
our knowing whether they belong to the left retina or to
the right. We use them only to tell us where their objects
lie. It takes long practice directed specially <i>ad hoc</i> to
teach us on which retina the sensations severally fall. Similarly
the different sensations which arise from the positions
of the eyeballs are used exclusively as signs of the
position of objects; an object directly fixated being localized
habitually at the intersection of the two optical axes,
but without any separate consciousness on our part that
the position of one axis is different from another. All we
are aware of is a consolidated feeling of a certain 'strain'
in the eyeballs, accompanied by the perception that just
so far in front and so far to the right or to the left there is
an object which we see. So that a 'muscular' process in
one eye is as likely to combine with a retinal process in the
other eye to effect a perceptive judgment, as two processes
in one eye are likely so to combine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another piece of circumstantial evidence for the feelings
of innervation is that adduced by Professor Mach, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If we stand on a bridge, and look at the water flowing beneath,
we usually feel ourselves at rest, whilst the water seems in motion.
Prolonged looking at the water, however, commonly has for its result
to make the bridge with the observer and surroundings suddenly seem
to move in the direction opposed to that of the water, whilst the water
itself assumes the appearance of standing still. The <i>relative</i> motion of
the objects is in both cases the same, and there must therefore be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
adequate <i>physiological</i> ground why sometimes one, sometimes the other
part of them is felt to move. In order to investigate the matter conveniently,
I had the simple
apparatus constructed which
is represented in Fig. 86. An
oil-cloth with a simple pattern
is horizontally stretched over
two cylinders (each 2 metres
long and 3 feet apart) and kept
in uniform motion by the help
of a crank. Across the cloth,
and some 30 cm. above it, is
stretched a string, with a knot <i>x</i>, which serves as a fixation-point for
the eye of the observer. If the observer <i>follow</i> with his eyes the
pattern of the cloth as it moves, he sees it in movement, himself and the
surroundings at rest. But if he looks at the <i>knot</i>, he soon feels as
if the entire room were moving contrary to the direction of the cloth,
whilst the latter seems to stand still. This change in the mode of
looking comes about in more or less time according to one's momentary
disposition, but usually it takes but a few seconds. If one once understands
the point, one can make the two appearances alternate at will.
Every following of the oil-cloth makes the observer stationary; every
fixation of the knot or <i>inattention to the oil-cloth, so that its pattern
becomes blurred,</i>, sets him in apparent motion."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Professor Mach proceeds to explain the phenomenon as
follows:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/fig_86.jpg" width="300" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 86.</div>
</div>



<blockquote>

<p>"Moving objects exert, as is well known, a peculiar motor stimulation
upon the eye, they draw our attention and our look after them. If the
look really follows them ... we assume that they move. But if the
eye, instead of following the moving objects, remains steadfastly at
rest, it must be that the constant stimulus to motion which it receives
is neutralized by an equally constant current of innervation flowing
into its motor apparatus. But this is just what would happen if the
steadfastly fixated point were itself moving uniformly in the other direction,
and we were following it with our eyes. When this comes
about, whatever motionless things are looked at must appear in motion."<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The knot <i>x</i>, the string, we ourselves, and all our stationary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
surroundings thus appear in movement, according
to Mach, because we are constantly innervating our eyeballs
to resist the <i>drag</i> exerted upon them by the pattern
or the flowing waves. I have myself repeated the observation
many times above flowing streams, but have never succeeded
in getting the full illusion as described by Mach.
I gain a sense of the movement of the bridge and of my
own body, but the river never seems absolutely to stop: it
still moves in one direction, whilst I float away in the other.
But, be the illusion partial or complete, a different explanation
of it from Professor Mach's seems to me the
more natural one to adopt. The illusion is said to cease
when, our attention being fully fixed on the moving oil-cloth,
we perceive the latter for what it is; and to recommence, on
the contrary, when we perceive the oil-cloth as a vaguely
moving background behind an object which we directly
fixate and whose position with regard to our own body is
unchanged. This, however, is the sort of consciousness
which we have whenever we are ourselves borne in a vehicle,
on horseback, or in a boat. As we and our belongings go
one way, the <i>whole background</i> goes the other. I should
rather, therefore, explain Professor Mach's illusion as
similar to the illusion at railroad-stations described above
on <a href="#Page_90">page 90</a>. The other train moves, but it makes ours seem
to move, because, filling the window as it does, it stands for
the time being as the total background. So here, the
water or oil-cloth stands for us as background <i>überhaupt</i>
whenever we seem to ourselves to be moving over it. The
relative motion felt by the retina is assigned to that one of
its components which we look at more in itself and less as
a mere <i>repoussoir</i>. This may be the knot above the oil-cloth
or the bridge beneath our feet, or it may be, on the
other hand, the oil-cloth's pattern or the surface of the
swirling stream. Similar changes may be produced in the
apparent motion of the moon and the clouds through which
it shines, by similarly altering the attention. Such alterations,
however, in our conception of which part of the visual
field is substantive object and which part background,
seem to have no connection with feelings of innervation. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
cannot, therefore, regard the observation of Prof. Mach as
any proof that the latter feelings exist.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The circumstantial evidence for the feeling of innervation
thus seems to break down like the introspective evidence.
But not only can we rebut experiments intended to prove
it, we can also adduce experiments which disprove it. A
person who moves a limb voluntarily must innervate it in
any case, and if he feels the innervation he ought to be able
to use the feeling to define what his limb is about, even
though the limb itself were anæsthetic. If, however, the
limb be totally anæsthetic, it turns out that he does not
know at all how much work it performs in its contraction&mdash;in
other words, he has no perception of the amount of innervation
which he exerts. A patient examined by Messrs.
Gley and Marillier beautifully showed this. His entire
arms, and his trunk down to the navel, were insensible both
superficially and deeply, but his arms were not paralyzed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We take three stone bottles&mdash;two of them are empty and weigh
each 350 grams; the third is full of mercury and weighs 1850 grams.
We ask L... to estimate their weight and tell us which is heaviest.
He declares that he finds them all three alike. With many days of interval
we made two series of six experiments each. The result was always
the same. The experiment, it need hardly be said, was arranged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
such wise that he could be informed neither by sight nor by hearing.
He even declared, holding in his hand the bottleful of mercury, that
he found it to have no weight.... We place successively in his hand
(his eyes being still bandaged) a piece of modelling wax, a stick of hard
wood, a thick India-rubber tube, a newspaper folded up lengthwise and
rumpled, and we make him squeeze these several objects. He feels no
difference of resistance and does not even perceive that anything is in
his hand."<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>M. Gley in another place<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> quotes experiments by Dr.
Bloch which prove that the sense which we have of our
limbs' position owes absolutely nothing to the feeling of innervation
put forth. Dr. Bloch stood opposite the angle of
a screen whose sides made an angle of about 90º, and tried
to place his hands symmetrically, or so that both should
fall on corresponding spots of the two screen-sides, which
were marked with squares for the purpose. The average
error being noted, one hand was then passively carried by
an assistant to a spot on its screen-side, and the other
actively sought the corresponding spot on the opposite
side. The accuracy of the correspondence proved to be
as great as when both arms were innervated voluntarily,
showing that the consciousness of innervation in the first
of the two experiments added nothing to the sense of the
limbs' position. Dr. Bloch then tried, pressing a certain
number of pages of a book between the thumb and forefinger
of one hand, to press an equal number between the
same fingers of the other hand. He did this just as well
when the fingers in question were drawn apart by India-rubber
bands as when they were uninterfered with, showing
that the physiologically much greater innervation-current
required in the former case had no effect upon the consciousness
of the movement made, so far as its spatial character
at any rate was concerned.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span></p>
<p>On the whole, then, it seems as probable as anything
can well be, that these feelings of innervation do not exist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
If the motor cells are distinct structures, they are as insentient
as the motor nerve-trunks are after the posterior roots
are cut. If they are not distinct structures, but are only
the last sensory cells, those at the 'mouth of the funnel,'<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
then their consciousness is that of kinæsthetic ideas and
sensations merely, and this consciousness accompanies the
rise of activity in them rather than its discharge. The entire
content and material of our consciousness&mdash;consciousness
of movement, as of all things else&mdash;is thus of peripheral
origin, and came to us in the first instance through
the peripheral nerves. If it be asked what we gain by this
sensationalistic conclusion, I reply that we gain at any rate
simplicity and uniformity. In the chapters on Space, on
Belief, on the Emotions, we found sensation to be a much
richer thing than is commonly supposed; and this chapter
seems at this point to fall into line with those. Then, as
for sensationalism being a degrading belief, which abolishes
all inward originality and spontaneity, there is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
to be said, that the advocates of inward spontaneity may be
turning their backs on its real citadel, when they make a
fight, on its behalf, for the consciousness of energy put forth
in the outgoing discharge. Let there be no such consciousness;
let all our thoughts of movements be of sensational
constitution; still in the emphasizing, choosing,
and espousing of one of them rather than another, in the
saying to it, 'be thou the reality for me,' there is ample
scope for our inward initiative to be shown. Here, it seems
to me, the true line between the passive materials and the
activity of the spirit should be drawn. It is certainly
false strategy to draw it between such ideas as are connected
with the outgoing and such as are connected with
the incoming neural wave.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the ideas by which we discriminate between one
movement and another, at the instant of deciding in our
mind which one we shall perform, are always of sensorial
origin, then the question arises, "Of which sensorial order
need they be?" It will be remembered that we distinguished
two orders of kinæsthetic impression, the <i>remote</i>
ones, made by the movement on the eye or ear or distant
skin, etc., and the <i>resident</i> ones, made on the moving parts
themselves, muscles, joints, etc. Now do resident images,
exclusively, form what I have called the mental cue, or will
remote ones equally suffice?</p>

<p><i>There can be no doubt whatever that the mental cue may be
either an image of the resident or of the remote kind.</i> Although,
at the outset of our learning a movement, it would seem
that the resident feelings must come strongly before consciousness
(cf. <a href="#Page_487">p. 487</a>), later this need not be the case.
The rule, in fact, would seem to be that they tend to lapse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
more and more from consciousness, and that the more
practised we become in a movement, the more 'remote' do
the ideas become which form its mental cue. What we are
<i>interested</i> in is what sticks in our consciousness; everything
else we get rid of as quickly as we can. Our resident feelings
of movement have no substantive interest for us at all,
as a rule. What interest us are the ends which the movement
is to attain. Such an end is generally an outer impression
on the eye or ear, or sometimes on the skin, nose,
or palate. Now let the idea of the end associate itself
definitely with the right motor innervation, and the thought
of the innervation's <i>resident</i> effects will become as great an
encumbrance as we formerly concluded that the feeling of
the innervation itself would be. The mind does not need it;
the end alone is enough.</p>

<p>The idea of the end, then, tends more and more to make
itself all-sufficient. Or, at any rate, if the kinæsthetic ideas
are called up at all, they are so swamped in the vivid
kinæsthetic feelings by which they are immediately overtaken
that we have no time to be aware of their separate
existence. As I write, I have no anticipation, as a thing
distinct from my sensation, of either the look or the digital
feel of the letters which flow from my pen. The words
chime on my mental <i>ear</i>, as it were, before I write them,
but not on my mental eye or hand. This comes from the
rapidity with which often-repeated movements follow on
their mental cue. An end consented to as soon as conceived
innervates directly the centre of the first movement of the
chain which leads to its accomplishment, and then the
whole chain rattles off <i>quasi</i>-reflexly, as was described on
pp. 115-6 of Vol. I.</p>

<p>The reader will certainly recognize this to be true in
all fluent and unhesitating voluntary acts. The only special
fiat there is at the outset of the performance. A man says
to himself, "I must change my shirt," and involuntarily he
has taken off his coat, and his fingers are at work in their
accustomed manner on his waistcoat-buttons, etc.; or
we say, "I must go downstairs," and ere we know it we
have risen, walked, and turned the handle of the door;&mdash;all
through the idea of an end coupled with a series of guiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
sensations which successively arise. It would seem indeed
that we fail of accuracy and certainty in our attainment of
the end whenever we are preoccupied with much ideal consciousness
of the means. We walk a beam the better the
less we think of the position of our feet upon it. We pitch
or catch, we shoot or chop the better the less tactile and
muscular (the less resident), and the more exclusively optical,
(the more remote) our consciousness is. Keep your <i>eye</i> on
the place aimed at, and your hand will fetch it; think of
your hand, and you will very likely miss your aim. Dr.
Southard found that he could touch a spot with a pencil-point
more accurately with a visual than with a tactile
mental cue. In the former case he looked at a small
object and closed his eyes before trying to touch it. In
the latter case he <i>placed</i> it with closed eyes, and then after
removing his hand tried to touch it again. The average
error with touch (when the results were most favorable)
was 17.13 mm. With sight it was only 12.37 mm.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>&mdash;All
these are plain results of introspection and observation.
By what neural machinery they are made possible we need
not, at this present stage, inquire.</p>

<p>In <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a> we saw how enormously individuals
differ in respect to their mental imagery. In the type of
imagination called <i>tactile</i> by the French authors, it is probable
that the kinæsthetic ideas are more prominent than in
my account. We must not expect too great a uniformity
in individual accounts, nor wrangle overmuch as to which
one 'truly' represents the process.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span></p>
<p>I trust that I have now made clear what that 'idea of
a movement' is which must precede it in order that it be
voluntary. It is not the thought of the innervation which
the movement requires. It is the anticipation of the movement's
sensible effects, resident or remote, and sometimes
very remote indeed. Such anticipations, to say the least,
determine <i>what</i> our movements shall be. I have spoken all
along as if they also might determine <i>that</i> they shall be.
This, no doubt, has disconcerted many readers, for it certainly
seems as if a special fiat, or consent to the movement
were required in addition to the mere conception of it, in
many cases of volition; and this fiat I have altogether left
out of my account. This leads us to the next point in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
psychology of the Will. It can be the more easily treated
now that we have got rid of so much tedious preliminary
matter.</p>


<h4>IDEO-MOTOR ACTION.</h4>


<p>The question is this: <i>Is the bare idea of a movement's sensible
effects its sufficient mental cue</i> (<a href="#Page_497">p. 497</a>), <i>or must there be
an additional mental antecedent, in the shape of a fiat, decision,
consent, volitional mandate, or other synonymous phenomenon of
consciousness, before the movement can follow?</i></p>

<p>I answer: Sometimes the bare idea is sufficient, but
sometimes an additional conscious element, in the shape of
a fiat, mandate, or express consent, has to intervene and
precede the movement. The cases without a fiat constitute
the more fundamental, because the more simple, variety.
The others involve a special complication, which must be
fully discussed at the proper time. For the present let us
turn to <i>ideo-motor action</i>, as it has been termed, or the sequence
of movement upon the mere thought of it, as the
type of the process of volition.</p>

<p>Wherever movement follows <i>unhesitatingly and immediately</i>
the notion of it in the mind, we have ideo-motor action.
We are then aware of nothing between the conception and
the execution. All sorts of neuro-muscular processes come
between, of course, but we know absolutely nothing of
them. We think the act, and it is done; and that is all
that introspection tells us of the matter. Dr. Carpenter,
who first used, I believe, the name of ideo-motor action,
placed it, if I mistake not, among the curiosities of our
mental life. The truth is that it is no curiosity, but simply
the normal process stripped of disguise. Whilst talking I
become conscious of a pin on the floor, or of some dust on
my sleeve. Without interrupting the conversation I brush
away the dust or pick up the pin. I make no express resolve,
but the mere perception of the object and the fleeting
notion of the act seem of themselves to bring the latter
about. Similarly, I sit at table after dinner and find
myself from time to time taking nuts or raisins out of the
dish and eating them. My dinner properly is over, and in
the heat of the conversation I am hardly aware of what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
do, but the perception of the fruit and the fleeting notion
that I may eat it seem fatally to bring the act about.
There is certainly no express fiat here; any more than there
is in all those habitual goings and comings and rearrangements
of ourselves which fill every hour of the day, and
which incoming sensations instigate so immediately that it
is often difficult to decide whether not to call them reflex
rather than voluntary acts. We have seen in Chapter IV
that the intermediary terms of an habitual series of acts
leading to an end are apt to be of this <i>quasi</i>-automatic sort.
As Lotze says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We see in writing or piano-playing a great number of very complicated
movements following quickly one upon the other, the instigative
representations of which remained scarcely a second in consciousness,
certainly not long enough to awaken any other volition than the general
one of resigning one's self without reserve to the passing over of representation
into action. All the acts of our daily life happen in this
wise: Our standing up, walking, talking, all this never demands a distinct
impulse of the will, but is adequately brought about by the pure
flux of thought."<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In all this the determining condition of the unhesitating
and resistless sequence of the act seems to be <i>the absence of
my conflicting notion in the mind</i>. Either there is nothing
else at all in the mind, or what is there does not conflict.
The hypnotic subject realizes the former condition. Ask
him what he is thinking about, and ten to one he will reply
'nothing.' The consequence is that he both believes everything
he is told, and performs every act that is suggested.
The suggestion may be a vocal command, or it may be the
performance before him of the movement required. Hypnotic
subjects in certain conditions repeat whatever they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
hear you say, and imitate whatever they see you do. Dr.
Féré says that certain waking persons of neurotic type, if
one repeatedly close and open one's hand before their eyes,
soon begin to have corresponding feelings in their own fingers,
and presently begin irresistibly to execute the movements
which they see. Under these conditions of 'preparation'
Dr. Féré found that his subjects could squeeze the
hand-dynamometer much more strongly than when abruptly
invited to do so. A few <i>passive</i> repetitions of a movement
will enable many enfeebled patients to execute it actively
with greater strength. These observations beautifully
show how the mere quickening of kinæsthetic ideas is
equivalent to a certain amount of tension towards discharge
in the centres.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We know what it is to get out of bed on a freezing
morning in a room without a fire, and how the very vital
principle within us protests against the ordeal. Probably
most persons have lain on certain mornings for an hour at
a time unable to brace themselves to the resolve. We
think how late we shall be, how the duties of the day will
suffer; we say, "I <i>must</i> get up, this is ignominious," etc.;
but still the warm couch feels too delicious, the cold outside
too cruel, and resolution faints away and postpones
itself again and again just as it seemed on the verge of
bursting the resistance and passing over into the decisive
act. Now how do we <i>ever</i> get up under such circumstances?
If I may generalize from my own experience, we more often
than not get up without any struggle or decision at all. We
suddenly find that we <i>have</i> got up. A fortunate lapse of
consciousness occurs; we forget both the warmth and the
cold; we fall into some revery connected with the day's
life, in the course of which the idea flashes across us,
"Hollo! I must lie here no longer"&mdash;an idea which at that
lucky instant awakens no contradictory or paralyzing suggestions,
and consequently produces immediately its appropriate
motor effects. It was our acute consciousness of
both the warmth and the cold during the period of struggle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
which paralyzed our activity then and kept our idea of rising
in the condition of <i>wish</i> and not of <i>will</i>. The moment
these inhibitory ideas ceased, the original idea exerted its
effects.</p>

<p>This case seems to me to contain in miniature form the
data for an entire psychology of volition. It was in fact
through meditating on the phenomenon in my own person
that I first became convinced of the truth of the doctrine
which these pages present, and which I need here illustrate
by no farther examples.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The reason why that doctrine is
not a self-evident truth is that we have so many ideas
which <i>do not</i> result in action. But it will be seen that in
every such case, without exception, that is because other
ideas simultaneously present rob them of their impulsive
power. But even here, and when a movement is inhibited
from <i>completely</i> taking place by contrary ideas, it will <i>incipiently</i>
take place. To quote Lotze once more:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The spectator accompanies the throwing of a billiard-ball, or the
thrust of the swordsman, with slight movements of his arm; the untaught
narrator tells his story with many gesticulations; the reader
while absorbed in the perusal of a battle-scene feels a slight tension run
through his muscular system, keeping time as it were with the actions
he is reading of. These results become the more marked the more we
are absorbed in thinking of the movements which suggest them; they
grow fainter exactly in proportion as a complex consciousness, under
the dominion of a crowd of other representations, withstands the passing
over of mental contemplation into outward action."</p></blockquote>

<p>The 'willing-game,' the exhibitions of so-called 'mind-reading,'
or more properly muscle-reading, which have lately
grown so fashionable, are based on this incipient obedience
of muscular contraction to idea, even when the
deliberate intention is that no contraction shall occur.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span></p>
<p>We may then lay it down for certain that <i>every representation
of a movement awakens in some degree the actual
movement which is its object; and awakens it in a maximum
degree whenever it is not kept from so doing by an antagonistic
representation present simultaneously to the mind.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The express fiat, or act of mental consent to the movement,
comes in when the neutralization of the antagonistic
and inhibitory idea is required. But that there is no express
fiat needed when the conditions are simple, the reader ought
now to be convinced. Lest, however, he should still share the
common prejudice that voluntary action without 'exertion
of will-power' is Hamlet with the prince's part left out, I
will make a few farther remarks. The first point to start
from in understanding voluntary action, and the possible
occurrence of it with no fiat or express resolve, is the fact
that consciousness is <i>in its very nature impulsive</i>.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> We do
not have a sensation or a thought and then have to <i>add</i>
something dynamic to it to get a movement. Every pulse
of feeling which we have is the correlate of some neural
activity that is already on its way to instigate a movement.
Our sensations and thoughts are but cross-sections, as it
were, of currents whose essential consequence is motion,
and which no sooner run in at one nerve than they run out
again at another. The popular notion that mere consciousness
as such is not essentially a forerunner of activity, that
the latter must result from some superadded 'will-force,'
is a very natural inference from those special cases in
which we think of an act for an indefinite length of time
without the action taking place. These cases, however, are
not the norm; they are cases of inhibition by antagonistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
thoughts. When the blocking is released we feel as if an
inward spring were let loose, and this is the additional impulse
or <i>fiat</i> upon which the act effectively succeeds. We
shall study anon the blocking and its release. Our higher
thought is full of it. But where there is no blocking, there
is naturally no hiatus between the thought-process and the
motor discharge. <i>Movement is the natural immediate effect
of feeling, irrespective of what the quality of the feeling may be.
It is so in reflex action, it is so in emotional expression, it is so
in the voluntary life.</i> Ideo-motor action is thus no paradox,
to be softened or explained away. It obeys the type of all
conscious action, and from it one must start to explain action
in which a special fiat is involved.</p>

<p>It may be remarked in passing, that the inhibition of a
movement no more involves an express effort or command
than its execution does. Either of them <i>may</i> require it.
But in all simple and ordinary cases, just as the bare presence
of one idea prompts a movement, so the bare presence
of another idea will prevent its taking place. Try to feel
as if you were crooking your finger, whilst keeping it
straight. In a minute it will fairly tingle with the imaginary
change of position; yet it will not sensibly move, because
<i>its not really moving</i> is also a part of what you have in
mind. Drop <i>this</i> idea, think of the movement purely and
simply, with all breaks off; and, presto! it takes place with
no effort at all.</p>

<p>A waking man's behavior is thus at all times the resultant
of two opposing neural forces. With unimaginable
fineness some currents among the cells and fibres of his
brain are playing on his motor nerves, whilst other currents,
as unimaginably fine, are playing on the first currents,
damming or helping them, altering their direction or
their speed. The upshot of it all is, that whilst the currents
must always end by being drained off through <i>some</i> motor
nerves, they are drained off sometimes through one set and
sometimes through another; and sometimes they keep each
other in equilibrium so long that a superficial observer may
think they are not drained off at all. Such an observer
must remember, however, that from the physiological point
of view a gesture, an expression of the brow, or an expulsion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
of the breath are movements as much as an act of
locomotion is. A king's breath slays as well as an assassin's
blow; and the outpouring of those currents which the
magic imponderable streaming of our ideas accompanies
need not always be of an explosive or otherwise physically
conspicuous kind.</p>


<h4>ACTION AFTER DELIBERATION.</h4>


<p>We are now in a position to describe <i>what happens in
deliberate action</i>, or when the mind is the seat of many ideas
related to each other in antagonistic or in favorable ways.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
One of the ideas is that of an act. By itself this idea would
prompt a movement; some of the additional considerations,
however, which are present to consciousness block the
motor discharge, whilst others, on the contrary, solicit it to
take place. The result is that peculiar feeling of inward
unrest known as <i>indecision</i>. Fortunately it is too familiar
to need description, for to describe it would be impossible.
As long as it lasts, with the various objects before the attention,
we are said to <i>deliberate</i>; and when finally the original
suggestion either prevails and makes the movement
take place, or gets definitively quenched by its antagonists,
we are said to <i>decide</i>, or to <i>utter our voluntary fiat</i> in favor of
one or the other course. The reinforcing and inhibiting
ideas meanwhile are termed the <i>reasons or motives</i> by which
the decision is brought about.</p>

<p>The process of deliberation contains endless degrees of
complication. At every moment of it our consciousness
is of an extremely complex object, namely the existence
of the whole set of motives and their conflict, as explained
on p. 275 of Vol. I. Of this object, the totality of
which is realized more or less dimly all the while, certain
parts stand out more or less sharply at one moment in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
foreground, and at another moment other parts, in consequence
of the oscillations of our attention, and of the 'associative'
flow of our ideas. But no matter how sharp the
foreground-reasons may be, or how imminently close to
bursting through the dam and carrying the motor consequences
their own way, the background, however dimly felt,
is always there; and its presence (so long as the indecision
actually lasts) serves as an effective check upon the irrevocable
discharge. The deliberation may last for weeks or
months, occupying at intervals the mind. The motives
which yesterday seemed full of urgency and blood and life
to-day feel strangely weak and pale and dead. But as little
to-day as to-morrow is the question finally resolved. Something
tells us that all this is provisional; that the weakened
reasons will wax strong again, and the stronger weaken;
that equilibrium is unreached; that testing our reasons, not
obeying them, is still the order of the day, and that we
must wait awhile, patient or impatiently, until our mind
is made up 'for good and all.' This inclining, first to one
then to another future, both of which we represent as possible,
resembles the oscillations to and fro of a material
body within the limits of its elasticity. There is inward
strain, but no outward rupture. And this condition,
plainly enough, is susceptible of indefinite continuance, as
well in the physical mass as in the mind. If the elasticity
give way, however, if the dam ever do break, and the currents
burst the crust, vacillation is over and decision is
irrevocably there.</p>

<p>The decision may come in any one of many modes. I
will try briefly to sketch the most characteristic types of it,
merely warning the reader that this is only an introspective
account of symptoms and phenomena, and that all questions
of causal agency, whether neural or spiritual, are relegated
to a later page.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The particular reasons for or against action are of course
infinitely various in concrete cases. But certain motives
are more or less constantly in play. One of these is <i>impatience
of the deliberative state</i>; or to express it otherwise,
proneness to act or to decide merely because action and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
decision are, as such, agreeable, and relieve the tension of
doubt and hesitancy. Thus it comes that we will often
take any course whatever which happens to be most vividly
before our minds, at the moment when this impulse to
decisive action becomes extreme.</p>

<p>Against this impulse we have the <i>dread of the irrevocable</i>,
which often engenders a type of character incapable of
prompt and vigorous resolve, except perhaps when surprised
into sudden activity. These two opposing motives
twine round whatever other motives may be present at the
moment when decision is imminent, and tend to precipitate
or retard it. The conflict of these motives so far as they
alone affect the matter of decision is a conflict as to <i>when</i> it
shall occur. One says 'now,' the other says 'not yet.'</p>

<p>Another constant component of the web of motivation is
the impulse to persist in a decision once made. There is
no more remarkable difference in human character than
that between resolute and irresolute natures. Neither the
physiological nor the psychical grounds of this difference
have yet been analyzed. Its symptom is that whereas in
the irresolute all decisions are provisional and liable to be
reversed, in the resolute they are settled once for all and
not disturbed again. Now into every one's deliberations
the representation of one alternative will often enter with
such sudden force as to carry the imagination with itself
exclusively, and to produce an apparently settled decision
in its own favor. These premature and spurious decisions
are of course known to everyone. They often seem ridiculous
in the light of the considerations that succeed them.
But it cannot be denied that in the resolute type of character
the accident that one of them has once been made
does afterwards enter as a motive additional to the more
genuine reasons why it should not be revoked, or if provisionally
revoked, why it should be made again. How
many of us persist in a precipitate course which, but for a
moment of heedlessness, we might never have entered upon,
simply because we hate to 'change our mind.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span></p>

<h4>FIVE TYPES OF DECISION.</h4>


<p>Turning now to the form of the decision itself, we may
distinguish four chief types. The first may be called <i>the
reasonable type</i>. It is that of those cases in which the
arguments for and against a given course seem gradually
and almost insensibly to settle themselves in the mind and
to end by leaving a clear balance in favor of one alternative,
which alternative we then adopt without effort or constraint.
Until this rational balancing of the books is consummated
we have a calm feeling that the evidence is not yet all in,
and this keeps action in suspense. But some day we wake
with the sense that we see the thing rightly, that no new
light will be thrown on the subject by farther delay, and
that the matter had better be settled <i>now</i>. In this easy
transition from doubt to assurance we seem to ourselves
almost passive; the 'reasons' which decide us appearing to
flow in from the nature of things, and to owe nothing to
our will. We have, however, a perfect sense of being <i>free</i>,
in that we are devoid of any feeling of coercion. The conclusive
reason for the decision in these cases usually is the
discovery that we can refer the case to a <i>class</i> upon which
we are accustomed to act unhesitatingly in a certain stereotyped
way. It may be said in general that a great part of
every deliberation consists in the turning over of all the
possible modes of <i>conceiving</i> the doing or not doing of the
act in point. The moment we hit upon a conception which
lets us apply some principle of action which is a fixed and
stable part of our Ego, our state of doubt is at an end.
Persons of authority, who have to make many decisions in
the day, carry with them a set of heads of classification,
each bearing its motor consequence, and under these they
seek as far as possible to range each new emergency as it
occurs. It is where the emergency belongs to a species
without precedent, to which consequently no cut-and-dried
maxim will apply, that we feel most at a loss, and are
distressed at the indeterminateness of our task. As soon,
however, as we see our way to a familiar classification, we
are at ease again. <i>In action as in reasoning, then, the great
thing is the quest of the right conception.</i> The concrete dilemmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
do not come to us with labels gummed upon their
backs. We may name them by many names. The wise
man is he who succeeds in finding the name which suits
the needs of the particular occasion best. A 'reasonable'
character is one who has a store of stable and worthy ends,
and who does not decide about an action till he has calmly
ascertained whether it be ministerial or detrimental to any
one of these.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the next two types of decision, the final fiat occurs
before the evidence is all 'in.' It often happens that no
paramount and authoritative reason for either course will
come. Either seems a case of a Good, and there is no
umpire as to which good should yield its place to the other.
We grow tired of long hesitation and inconclusiveness, and
the hour may come when we feel that even a bad decision is
better than no decision at all. Under these conditions it
will often happen that some accidental circumstance, supervening
at a particular movement upon our mental weariness,
will upset the balance in the direction of one of the alternatives,
to which then we feel ourselves committed, although
an opposite accident at the same time might have
produced the opposite result.</p>

<p>In the <i>second type</i> of case our feeling is to a certain
extent that of letting ourselves drift with a certain indifferent
acquiescence in a direction accidentally determined
<i>from without</i>, with the conviction that, after all, we
might as well stand by this course as by the other, and
that things are in any event sure to turn out sufficiently
right.</p>

<p><i>In the third type</i> the determination seems equally accidental,
but it comes from within, and not from without.
It often happens, when the absence of imperative principle
is perplexing and suspense distracting, that we find ourselves
acting, as it were, automatically, and as if by a spontaneous
discharge of our nerves, in the direction of one of
the horns of the dilemma. But so exciting is this sense of
motion after our intolerable pent-up state, that we eagerly
throw ourselves into it. 'Forward now!' we inwardly cry,
'though the heavens fall.' This reckless and exultant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
espousal of an energy so little premeditated by us that we
feel rather like passive spectators cheering on the display
of some extraneous force than like voluntary agents, is a
type of decision too abrupt and tumultuous to occur often
in humdrum and cool-blooded natures. But it is probably
frequent in persons of strong emotional endowment
and unstable or vacillating character. And in men of the
world-shaking type, the Napoleons, Luthers, etc., in whom
tenacious passion combines with ebullient activity, when by
any chance the passion's outlet has been dammed by scruples
or apprehensions, the resolution is probably often of this
catastrophic kind. The flood breaks quite unexpectedly
through the dam. That it should so often do so is quite
sufficient to account for the tendency of these characters to
a fatalistic mood of mind. And the fatalistic mood itself
is sure to reinforce the strength of the energy just started
on its exciting path of discharge.</p>

<p>There is a <i>fourth form</i> of decision, which often ends
deliberation as suddenly as the third form does. It comes
when, in consequence of some outer experience or some
inexplicable inward charge, <i>we suddenly pass from the easy
and careless to the sober and strenuous mood,</i> or possibly the
other way. The whole scale of values of our motives and
impulses then undergoes a change like that which a change
of the observer's level produces on a view. The most
sobering possible agents are objects of grief and fear.
When one of these affects us, all 'light fantastic' notions
lose their motive power, all solemn ones find theirs multiplied
many-fold. The consequence is an instant abandonment
of the more trivial projects with which we had been
dallying, and an instant practical acceptance of the more
grim and earnest alternative which till then could not
extort our mind's consent. All those 'changes of heart,'
'awakenings of conscience,' etc., which make new men of
so many of us, may be classed under this head. The character
abruptly rises to another 'level,' and deliberation
comes to an immediate end.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span></p>
<p>In the <i>fifth and final type</i> of decision, the feeling that
the evidence is all in, and that reason has balanced the
books, may be either present or absent. But in either case
we feel, in deciding, as if we ourselves by our own wilful
act inclined the beam; in the former case by adding our
living effort to the weight of the logical reason which,
taken alone, seems powerless to make the act discharge;
in the latter by a kind of creative contribution of something
instead of a reason which does a reason's work. The slow
dead heave of the will that is felt in these instances makes
of them a class altogether different subjectively from all
the three preceding classes. What the heave of the will
betokens metaphysically, what the effort might lead us to
infer about a will-power distinct from motives, are not
matters that concern us yet. Subjectively and phenomenally,
the <i>feeling of effort</i>, absent from the former decisions,
accompanies these. Whether it be the dreary resignation
for the sake of austere and naked duty of all sorts of rich
mundane delights, or whether it be the heavy resolve that
of two mutually exclusive trains of future fact, both sweet
and good, and with no strictly objective or imperative
principle of choice between them, one shall forevermore
become impossible, while the other shall become reality,
it is a desolate and acrid sort of act, an excursion into a lonesome
moral wilderness. If examined closely, its chief difference
from the three former cases appears to be that in those
cases the mind at the moment of deciding on the triumphant
alternative dropped the other one wholly or nearly
out of sight, whereas here both alternatives are steadily
held in view, and in the very act of murdering the vanquished
possibility the chooser realizes how much in that
instant he is making himself lose. It is deliberately
driving a thorn into one's flesh; and the sense of <i>inward
effort</i> with which the act is accompanied is an element
which sets the fourth type of decision in strong contrast
with the previous three varieties, and makes of it an altogether
peculiar sort of mental phenomenon. The immense
majority of human decisions are decisions without effort. In
comparatively few of them, in most people, does effort accompany
the final act. We are, I think, misled into supposing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
effort is more frequent than it is, by the fact that <i>during
deliberation</i> we so often have a feeling of how great an effort
it would take to make a decision <i>now</i>. Later, after the decision
has made itself with ease, we recollect this and
erroneously suppose the effort also to have been made then.</p>

<p>The existence of the effort as a phenomenal fact in our
consciousness cannot of course be doubted or denied. Its
significance, on the other hand, is a matter about which the
gravest difference of opinion prevails. Questions as momentous
as that of the very existence of spiritual causality,
as vast as that of universal predestination or free-will, depend
on its interpretation. It therefore becomes essential
that we study with some care the conditions under which
the feeling of volitional effort is found.</p>


<h4>THE FEELING OF EFFORT.</h4>


<p>When, awhile back (<a href="#Page_526">p. 526</a>), I said that <i>consciousness</i> (or
the neural process which goes with it) <i>is in its very nature
impulsive,</i> I added in a note the proviso that <i>it must be
sufficiently intense</i>. Now there are remarkable differences
in the power of different sorts of consciousness to excite
movement. The intensity of some feelings is practically
apt to be below the discharging point, whilst that of others
is apt to be above it. By practically apt, I mean apt under
ordinary circumstances. These circumstances may be
habitual inhibitions, like that comfortable feeling of the
<i>dolce far niente</i> which gives to each and all of us a certain
dose of laziness only to be overcome by the acuteness of
the impulsive spur; or they may consist in the native
inertia, or internal resistance, of the motor centres themselves
making explosion impossible until a certain inward
tension has been reached and overpast. These conditions
may vary from one person to another and in the same person
from time to time. The neural inertia may wax or wane,
and the habitual inhibitions dwindle or augment. The intensity
of particular thought-processes and stimulations
may also change independently, and particular paths of
association grow more pervious or less so. There thus result
great possibilities of alteration in the actual impulsive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
efficacy of particular motives compared with others.
It is where the normally less efficacious motive becomes
more efficacious and the normally more efficacious one less
so that actions ordinarily effortless, or abstinences ordinarily
easy, either become impossible or are effected, if at
all, by the expenditure of effort. A little more description
will make it plainer what these cases are.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>There is a certain normal ratio in the impulsive power of
different sorts of motive, which characterizes what may be called
ordinary healthiness of will,</i> and which is departed from only
at exceptional times or by exceptional individuals. The
states of mind which normally possess the most impulsive
quality are either those which represent objects of
passion, appetite, or emotion&mdash;objects of instinctive reaction,
in short; or they are feelings or ideas of pleasure or of
pain; or ideas which for any reason we have grown accustomed
to obey so that the habit of reacting on them is ingrained;
or finally, in comparison with ideas of remoter
objects, they are ideas of objects present or near in space
and time. Compared with these various objects, all far-off
considerations, all highly abstract conceptions, unaccustomed
reasons, and motives foreign to the instinctive history
of the race, have little or no impulsive power. They prevail,
when they ever do prevail, <i>with effort; and the normal,</i> as
distinguished from the pathological, <i>sphere of effort is thus
found wherever non-instinctive motives to behavior are to rule
the day.</i></p>

<p>Healthiness of will moreover requires a certain amount
of complication in the process which precedes the fiat or
the act. Each stimulus or idea, at the same time that it
wakens its own impulse, must arouse other ideas (associated
and consequential) with their impulses, and action must
follow, neither too slowly nor too rapidly, as the resultant
of all the forces thus engaged. Even when the decision is
very prompt, there is thus a sort of preliminary survey of
the field and a vision of which course is best before the
fiat comes. And where the will is healthy, <i>the vision must
be right</i> (i.e., the motives must be on the whole in a normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
or not too unusual ratio to each other), <i>and the action must
obey the vision's lead.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Unhealthiness of will may thus come about in many ways.</i>
The action may follow the stimulus or idea too rapidly,
leaving no time for the arousal of restraining associates&mdash;<i>we
then have a precipitate will</i>. Or, although the associates
may come, the ratio which the impulsive and inhibitive
forces normally bear to each other may be distorted, and
we then have <i>a will which is perverse</i>. The perversity, in
turn, may be due to either of many causes&mdash;too much intensity,
or too little, here; too much or too little inertia
there; or elsewhere too much or too little inhibitory power.
<i>If we compare the outward symptoms of perversity together,
they fall into two groups,</i> in one of which normal actions are
impossible, and in the other abnormal ones are irrepressible.
Briefly, <i>we may call them respectively the obstructed and
the explosive will.</i></p>

<p>It must be kept in mind, however, that since the resultant
action is always due to the <i>ratio</i> between the obstructive
and the explosive forces which are present, we never can
tell by the mere outward symptoms to what <i>elementary</i>
cause the perversion of a man's will may be due, whether
to an increase of one component or a diminution of the
other. One may grow explosive as readily by losing the
usual brakes as by getting up more of the impulsive steam;
and one may find things impossible as well through the enfeeblement
of the original desire as through the advent of
new lions in the path. As Dr. Clouston says, "the driver
may be so weak that he cannot control well-broken horses,
or the horses may be so hard-mouthed that no driver can
pull them up." In some concrete cases (whether of explosive
or of obstructed will) it is difficult to tell whether the
trouble is due to inhibitory or to impulsive change. Generally,
however, we can make a plausible guess at the truth.</p>


<h4>THE EXPLOSIVE WILL.</h4>


<p>There is a normal type of character, for example, in
which impulses seem to discharge so promptly into movements
that inhibitions get no time to arise. These are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
'dare-devil' and 'mercurial' temperaments, overflowing with
animation, and fizzling with talk, which are so common in the
Latin and Celtic races, and with which the cold-blooded and
long-headed English character forms so marked a contrast.
Monkeys these people seem to us, whilst we seem to them
reptilian. It is quite impossible to judge, as between an obstructed
and an explosive individual, which has the greatest
sum of vital energy. An explosive Italian with good perception
and intellect will cut a figure as a perfectly tremendous
fellow, on an inward capital that could be tucked
away inside of an obstructed Yankee and hardly let you
know that it was there. He will be the king of his company,
sing all the songs and make all the speeches, lead the parties,
carry out the practical jokes, kiss all the girls, fight the
men, and, if need be, lead the forlorn hopes and enterprises,
so that an onlooker would think he has more life in his little
finger than can exist in the whole body of a correct judicious
fellow. But the judicious fellow all the while may have all
these possibilities and more besides, ready to break out in
the same or even a more violent way, if only the brakes
were taken off. It is the absence of scruples, of consequences,
of considerations, the extraordinary simplification
of each moment's mental outlook, that gives to the explosive
individual such motor energy and ease; it need not be the
greater intensity of any of his passions, motives, or thoughts.
As mental evolution goes on, the complexity of human consciousness
grows ever greater, and with it the multiplication
of the inhibitions to which every impulse is exposed. But
this predominance of inhibition has a bad as well as a good
side; and if a man's impulses are in the main orderly as
well as prompt, if he has courage to accept their consequences,
and intellect to lead them to a successful end, he
is all the better for his hair-trigger organization, and for
not being 'sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought.'
Many of the most successful military and revolutionary
characters in history have belonged to this simple but quick-witted
impulsive type. Problems come much harder to
reflective and inhibitive minds. They can, it is true, solve
much vaster problems; and they can avoid many a mistake
to which the men of impulse are exposed. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
the latter do not make mistakes, or when they are always
able to retrieve them, theirs is one of the most engaging and
indispensable of human types.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>In infancy, and in certain conditions of exhaustion as
well as in peculiar pathological states, the inhibitory power
may fail to arrest the explosions of the impulsive discharge.
We have then an explosive temperament temporarily realized
in an individual who at other times may be of a relatively
obstructed type. I cannot do better here than copy
a few pages from Dr. Clouston's excellent work:<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Take a child of six months, and there is absolutely no such brain-power
existent as mental inhibition; no desire or tendency is stopped
by a mental act.... At a year old the rudiments of the great
faculty of self-control are clearly apparent in most children. They
will resist the desire to seize the gas-flame, they will not upset
the milk-jug, they will obey orders to sit still when they want to run
about, all through a higher mental inhibition. But the power of
control is just as gradual a development as the motions of the hands....
Look at a more complicated act, that will be recognized by any
competent physiologist to be automatic and beyond the control of any
ordinary inhibitory power, e.g., irritate and tease a child of one or two
years sufficiently, and it will suddenly strike out at you; suddenly
strike at a man, and he will either perform an act of defence or offence,
or both, quite automatically, and without power of controlling himself.
Place a bright tempting toy before a child of a year, and it will be instantly
appropriated. Place cold water before a man dying of thirst,
and he will take and drink it without power of doing otherwise. Exhaustion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
of nervous energy always lessens the inhibitory power. Who
is not conscious of this? 'Irritability' is one manifestation of this.
Many persons have so small a stock of reserve brain-power&mdash;that most
valuable of all brain-qualities&mdash;that it is soon used up, and you see at
once that they lose their power of self-control very soon. They are angels
or demons just as they are fresh or tired. That surplus store of
energy or resistive force which provides, in persons normally constituted,
that moderate excesses in all directions shall do no great harm so long
as they are not too often repeated, not being present in these people,
overwork, over-drinking, or small debauches leave them at the mercy
of their morbid impulses without power of resistance.... Woe to the
man who uses up his surplus stock of brain-inhibition too near the bitter
end, or too often!... The physiological word inhibition can be used
synonymously with the psychological and ethical expression self-control,
or with the will when exercised in certain directions. It is the characteristic
of most forms of mental disease for self-control to be lost, but
this loss is usually part of a general mental affection with melancholic,
maniacal, demented, or delusional symptoms as the chief manifestation
of the disease. There are other cases, not so numerous, where the loss
of the power of inhibition is the chief and by far the most marked
symptom.... I shall call this form 'Inhibitory Insanity.' Some of
these cases have uncontrollable impulses to violence and destruction,
others to homicide, others to suicide prompted by no depressed feelings,
others to acts of animal gratification (satyriasis, nymphomania,
erotomania, bestiality), others to drinking too much alcohol
(dipsomania), others towards setting things on fire (pyromania), others
to stealing (kleptomania), and others towards immoralities of all sorts.
The impulsive tendencies and morbid desires are innumerable in kind.
Many of these varieties of Insanity have been distinguished by distinct
names. To dig up and eat dead bodies (necrophilism), to wander from
home and throw off the restraints of society (planomania), to act like a
wild beast (lycanthropia), etc. Action from impulse in all these directions
may take place from a loss of controlling power in the higher regions
of the brain, or from an over-development of energy in certain
portions of the brain, which the normal power of inhibition cannot
control. The driver may be so weak that he cannot control well-broken
horses, or the horses may be so hard-mouthed that no driver can pull
them up. Both conditions may arise from purely cerebral disorder ... or
may be reflex.... The <i>ego</i>, the man, the will, may be non-existent
for the time. The most perfect examples of this are murders done
during somnambulism or epileptic unconsciousness, or acts done in the
hypnotic state. There is no conscious desire to attain the object at all
in such cases. In other cases there is consciousness and memory
present, but no power of restraining action. The simplest example of
this is where an imbecile or dement, seeing something glittering, appropriates
it to himself, or when he commits indecent sexual acts. Through
disease a previously sane and vigorous-minded person may get into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
same state. The motives that would lead other persons not to do such
acts do not operate in such persons. I have known a man steal who
said he had no intense longing for the article he appropriated at all, at
least consciously, but his will was in abeyance, and he could not resist
the ordinary desire of possession common to all human nature."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not only those technically classed imbeciles and
dements who exhibit this promptitude of impulse and tardiness
of inhibition. Ask half the common drunkards you
know why it is that they fall so often a prey to temptation,
and they will say that most of the time they cannot tell.
It is a sort of vertigo with them. Their nervous centres
have become a sluice-way pathologically unlocked by every
passing conception of a bottle and a glass. They do not thirst
for the beverage; the taste of it may even appear repugnant;
and they perfectly foresee the morrow's remorse.
But when they think of the liquor or see it, they find themselves
preparing to drink, and do not stop themselves: and
more than this they cannot say. Similarly a man may
lead a life of incessant love-making or sexual indulgence,
though what spurs him thereto seems rather to be suggestions
and notions of possibility than any overweening
strength in his affections or lusts. He may even be physically
impotent all the while. The paths of natural (or it
may be unnatural) impulse are so pervious in these characters
that the slightest rise in the level of innervation produces
an overflow. It is the condition recognized in pathology
as 'irritable weakness.' The phase known as nascency
or latency is so short in the excitement of the neural tissues
that there is no opportunity for strain or tension to accumulate
within them; and the consequence is that with all the
agitation and activity, the amount of real feeling engaged
may be very small. The hysterical temperament is the playground
<i>par excellence</i> of this unstable equilibrium. One of
these subjects will be filled with what seems the most genuine
and settled aversion to a certain line of conduct, and
the very next <i>instant</i> follow the stirring of temptation and
plunge in it up to the neck. Professor Ribot well gives the
name of 'Le Règne des Caprices' to the chapter in which
he describes the hysterical temperament in his interesting
little monograph 'The Diseases of the Will.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>
<p>Disorderly and impulsive conduct may, on the other
hand, come about where the neural tissues preserve their
proper inward tone, and where the inhibitory power is normal
or even unusually great. In such cases <i>the strength of
the impulsive idea is preternaturally exalted</i>, and what would
be for most people the passing suggestion of a possibility
becomes a gnawing, craving urgency to act. Works on insanity
are full of examples of these morbid insistent ideas,
in obstinately struggling against which the unfortunate
victim's soul often sweats with agony, ere at last it gets
swept away. One instance will stand for many; M. Ribot
quotes it from Calmeil:<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Glénadal, having lost his father in infancy, was brought up by his
mother, whom he adored. At sixteen, his character, till then good
and docile, changed. He became gloomy and taciturn. Pressed with
questions by his mother, he decided at last to make a confession. 'To
you,' said he, 'I owe everything; I love you with all my soul; yet for
some time past an incessant idea drives me to kill you. Prevent so
terrible a misfortune from happening, in case some day the temptation
should overpower me: allow me to enlist.' Notwithstanding pressing
solicitations, he was firm in his resolve, went off, and was a good soldier.
Still a secret impulse stimulated him without cessation to desert in
order to come home and kill his mother. At the end of his term of
service the idea was as strong as on the first day. He enlisted for
another term. The murderous instinct persisted, but substituted
another victim. He no longer thought of killing his mother&mdash;the horrible
impulse pointed day and night towards his sister-in-law. In order
to resist the second impulse, he condemned himself to perpetual exile.
At this time one of his old neighbors arrived in the regiment. Glénadal
confesses all his trouble. 'Be at rest,' said the other. 'Your crime
is impossible; your sister-in-law has just died.' At these words Glénadal
rises like a delivered captive. Joy fills his heart. He travels to the
home of his childhood, unvisited for so many years. But as he arrives
he sees his sister-in-law living. He gives a cry, and the terrible impulse
seizes him again as a prey. That very evening he makes his brother
tie him fast. 'Take a solid rope, bind me like a wolf in the barn, and
go and tell Dr. Calmeil....' From him he got admission to an insane
asylum. The evening before his entrance he wrote to the director of
the establishment: 'Sir, I am to become an inmate of your house. I
shall behave there as if I were in the regiment. You will think me
cured. At moments perhaps I shall pretend to be so. Never believe
me. Never let me out on any pretext. If I beg to be released, double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>

commit a crime which I abhor.'"<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The craving for drink in real dipsomaniacs, or for opium
or chloral in those subjugated, is of a strength of which
normal persons can form no conception. "Were a keg
of rum in one corner of a room and were a cannon constantly
discharging balls between me and it, I could not
refrain from passing before that cannon in order to get the
rum;" "If a bottle of brandy stood at one hand and the
pit of hell yawned at the other, and I were convinced that
I should be pushed in as sure as I took one glass, I could
not refrain:" such statements abound in dipsomaniacs'
mouths. Dr. Mussey of Cincinnati relates this case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A few years ago a tippler was put into an almshouse in this State.
Within a few days he had devised various expedients to procure rum,
but failed. At length, however, he hit upon one which was successful.
He went into the wood-yard of the establishment, placed one hand upon
the block, and with an axe in the other, struck it off at a single blow.
With the stump raised and streaming he ran into the house and cried,
'Get some rum! get some rum! my hand is off!' In the confusion and
bustle of the occasion a bowl of rum was brought, into which he
plunged the bleeding member of his body, then raising the bowl to his
mouth, drank freely, and exultingly exclaimed, 'Now I am satisfied.'
Dr. J. E. Turner tells of a man who, while under treatment for inebriety,
during four weeks secretly drank the alcohol from six jars containing
morbid specimens. On asking him why he had committed this loathsome
act, he replied: 'Sir, it is as impossible for me to control this diseased
appetite as it is for me to control the pulsations of my heart.'"<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The passion of love may be called a monomania to
which all of us are subject, however otherwise sane. It
can coexist with contempt and even hatred for the 'object'
which inspires it, and whilst it lasts the whole life of the
man is altered by its presence. Alfieri thus describes the
struggles of his unusually powerful inhibitive power with
his abnormally excited impulses toward a certain lady:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Contemptible in my own eyes, I fell into such a state of melancholy
as would, if long continued, inevitably have led to insanity or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
death. I continued to wear my disgraceful fetters till towards the end
of January, 1775, when my rage, which had hitherto so often been restrained
within bounds, broke forth with the greatest violence. On
returning one evening from the opera (the most insipid and tiresome
amusement in Italy), where I had passed several hours in the box of
the woman who was by turns the object of my antipathy and my love,
I took the firm determination of emancipating myself forever from her
yoke. Experience had taught me that flight, so far from enabling me
to persevere in my resolutions, tended on the contrary to weaken and
destroy them; I was inclined therefore to subject myself to a still more
severe trial, imagining from the obstinacy and peculiarity of my character
that I should succeed most certainly by the adoption of such
measures as would compel me to make the greatest efforts. I determined
never to leave the house, which, as I have already said, was
exactly opposite that of the lady; to gaze at her windows, to see her go
in and out every day, to listen to the sound of her voice, though firmly
resolved that no advances on her part, either direct or indirect, no
tender remembrances, nor in short any other means which might be
employed, should ever again tempt me to a revival of our friendship. I
was determined to die or liberate myself from my disgraceful thraldom.
In order to give stability to my purpose, and to render it impossible for
me to waver without the imputation of dishonor, I communicated my
determination to one of my friends, who was greatly attached to me,
and whom I highly esteemed. He had lamented the state of mind into
which I had fallen, but not wishing to give countenance to my conduct,
and seeing the impossibility of inducing me to abandon it, he had for
some time ceased to visit at my house. In the few lines which I addressed
to him, I briefly stated the resolution I had adopted, and as a
pledge of my constancy I sent him a long tress of my ugly red hair. I
had purposely caused it to be cut off in order to prevent my going out,
as no one but clowns and sailors then appeared in public with short
hair. I concluded my billet by conjuring him to strengthen and aid my
fortitude by his presence and example. Isolated in this manner in my
own house, I prohibited all species of intercourse, and passed the first
fifteen days in uttering the most frightful lamentations and groans.
Some of my friends came to visit me, and appeared to commiserate my
situation, perhaps because I did not myself complain; but my figure
and whole appearance bespoke my sufferings. Wishing to read something
I had recourse to the gazettes, whole pages of which I frequently
ran over without understanding a single word.... I passed more than
two months till the end of March 1775, in a state bordering on frenzy;
but about this time a new idea darted into my mind, which tended to
assuage my melancholy."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the idea of poetical composition, at which
Alfieri describes his first attempts, made under these diseased
circumstances, and goes on:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"The only good that occurred to me from this whim was that of
gradually detaching me from love, and of awakening my reason which
had so long lain dormant. I no longer found it necessary to cause myself
to be tied with cords to a chair, in order to prevent me from leaving
my house and returning to that of my lady. This had been one of the
expedients I devised to render myself wise by force. The cords were
concealed under a large mantle in which I was enveloped, and only one
hand remained at liberty. Of all those who came to see me, not one
suspected I was bound down in this manner. I remained in this situation
for whole hours; Elias, who was my jailer, was alone intrusted with
the secret. He always liberated me, as he had been enjoined, whenever
the paroxysms of my rage subsided. Of all the whimsical methods
which I employed, however, the most curious was that of appearing
in masquerade at the theatre towards the end of the carnival. Habited
as Apollo, I ventured to present myself with a lyre, on which I played
as well as I was able and sang some bad verses of my own composing.
Such effrontery was diametrically opposite to my natural character.
The only excuse I can offer for such scenes was my inability to resist an
imperious passion. I felt that it was necessary to place an insuperable
barrier between its object and me; and I saw that the strongest of all
was the shame to which I should expose myself by renewing an attachment
which I had so publicly turned into ridicule."<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Often the insistent idea is of a trivial sort, but it may
wear the patient's life out. His hands feel dirty, they must
be washed. He <i>knows</i> they are not dirty; yet to get rid of
the teasing idea he washes them. The idea, however, returns
in a moment, and the unfortunate victim, who is not in the
least deluded <i>intellectually</i>, will end by spending the whole
day at the wash-stand. Or his clothes are not 'rightly'
put on; and to banish the thought he takes them off and
puts them on again, till his toilet consumes two or three
hours of time. Most people have the potentiality of this
disease. To few has it not happened to conceive, after getting
into bed, that they may have forgotten to lock the
front door, or to turn out the entry gas. And few of us
have not on some occasion got up to repeat the performance,
less because they believed in the reality of its omission
than because only so could they banish the worrying
doubt and get to sleep.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<h4>THE OBSTRUCTED WILL.</h4>


<p>In striking contrast with the cases in which inhibition
is insufficient or impulsion in excess are those in which
impulsion is insufficient or inhibition of in excess. We all
know the condition described on p. 404 of Vol. I, in which the
mind for a few moments seems to lose its focussing power
and to be unable to rally its attention to any determinate
thing. At such times we sit blankly staring and do nothing.
The objects of consciousness fail to touch the quick or break
the skin. They are there, but do not reach the level of effectiveness.
This state of non-efficacious presence is the normal
condition of <i>some</i> objects, in all of us. Great fatigue
or exhaustion may make it the condition of almost all objects;
and an apathy resembling that then brought about
is recognized in asylums under the name of <i>abulia</i> as a
symptom of mental disease. The healthy state of the will
requires, as aforesaid, both that vision should be right, and
that action should obey its lead. But in the morbid condition
in question the vision may be wholly unaffected,
and the intellect clear, and yet the act either fails to follow
or follows in some other way. "<i>Video meliora proboque,
deteriora sequor</i>" is the classic expression of the latter condition
of mind. The former it is to which the name <i>abulia</i>
peculiarly applies. The patients, says Guislain,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"are able to will inwardly, mentally, according to the dictates of reason.
They experience the desire to act, but they are powerless to act as they
should.... Their will cannot overpass certain limits: one would say
that the force of action within them is blocked up: the <i>I will</i> does not
transform itself into impulsive volition, into active determination.
Some of these patients wonder themselves at the impotence with which
their will is smitten. If you abandon them to themselves, they pass
whole days in their bed or on a chair. If one speaks to them or excites
them, they express themselves properly though briefly; and judge of
things pretty well."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <a href="#CHAPTER_XXI287">Chapter XXI</a>, as will be remembered, it was said
that the sentiment of reality with which an object appealed
to the mind is proportionate (amongst other things)
to its efficacy as a stimulus to the will. Here we get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
obverse side of the truth. Those ideas, objects, considerations,
which (in these lethargic states) fail to <i>get to</i> the
will, fail to draw blood, seem, in so far forth, distant and unreal.
The connection of the reality of things with their
effectiveness as motives is a tale that has never yet been
fully told. The moral tragedy of human life comes almost
wholly from the fact that the link is ruptured which normally
should hold between vision of the truth and action,
and that this pungent sense of effective reality will not attach
to certain ideas. Men do not differ so much in their
mere feelings and conceptions. Their notions of possibility
and their ideals are not as far apart as might be argued
from their differing fates. No class of them have better
sentiments or feel more constantly the difference between
the higher and the lower path in life than the hopeless
failures, the sentimentalists, the drunkards, the schemers,
the 'dead-beats,' whose life is one long contradiction
between knowledge and action, and who, with full command
of theory, never get to holding their limp characters
erect. No one eats of the fruit of the tree of knowledge
as they do; as far as moral insight goes, in comparison with
them, the orderly and prosperous philistines whom they
scandalize are sucking babes. And yet their moral
knowledge, always there grumbling and rumbling in the
background,&mdash;discerning, commenting, protesting, longing,
half resolving,&mdash;never wholly resolves, never gets its voice
out of the minor into the major key, or its speech out of
the subjunctive into the imperative mood, never breaks
the spell, never takes the helm into its hands. In such
characters as Rousseau and Restif it would seem as if the
lower motives had all the impulsive efficacy in their
hands. Like trains with the right of way, they retain exclusive
possession of the track. The more ideal motives
exist alongside of them in profusion, but they never get
switched on, and the man's conduct is no more influenced
by them than an express train is influenced by a wayfarer
standing by the roadside and calling to be taken aboard.
They are an inert accompaniment to the end of time; and
the consciousness of inward hollowness that accrues from
habitually seeing the better only to do the worse, is one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
the saddest feelings one can bear with him through this
vale of tears.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now see at one view when it is that effort complicates
volition. It does so whenever a rarer and more ideal impulse
is called upon to neutralize others of a more instinctive
and habitual kind; it does so whenever strongly explosive
tendencies are checked, or strongly obstructive
conditions overcome. The <i>âme bien née</i>, the child of the
sunshine, at whose birth the fairies made their gifts, does
not need much of it in his life. The hero and the neurotic
subject, on the other hand, do. Now our spontaneous way
of conceiving the effort, under all these circumstances, is as
an active force adding its strength to that of the motives
which ultimately prevail. When outer forces impinge upon
a body, we say that the resultant motion is in the line of
least resistance, or of greatest traction. But it is a curious
fact that our spontaneous language never speaks of volition
with effort in this way. Of course if we proceed <i>a priori</i>
and define the line of least resistance as the line that is
followed, the physical law must also hold good in the mental
sphere. But we <i>feel</i>, in all hard cases of volition, as if the
line taken, when the rarer and more ideal motives prevail,
were the line of greater resistance, and as if the line of
coarser motivation were the more pervious and easy one,
even at the very moment when we refuse to follow it. He
who under the surgeon's knife represses cries of pain, or
he who exposes himself to social obloquy for duty's sake,
feels as if he were following the line of greatest temporary
resistance. He speaks of conquering and overcoming his
impulses and temptations.</p>

<p>But the sluggard, the drunkard, the coward, never talk
of their conduct in that way or say they resist their energy,
overcome their sobriety, conquer their courage, and so
forth. If in general we class all springs of action as propensities
on the one hand and ideals on the other, the sensualist
never says of his behavior that it results from a
victory over his ideals, but the moralist always speaks of
his as a victory over his propensities. The sensualist uses
terms of inactivity, says he forgets his ideals, is deaf to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
duty, and so forth; which terms seem to imply that the
ideal motives <i>per se</i> can be annulled without energy or
effort, and that the strongest mere traction lies in the line
of the propensities. The ideal impulse appears, in comparison
with this, a still small voice which must be artificially
reinforced to prevail. Effort is what reinforces it, making
things seem as if, while the force of propensity were essentially
a fixed quantity, the ideal force might be of various
amount. But what determines the amount of the effort
when, by its aid, an ideal motive becomes victorious over a
great sensual resistance? The very greatness of the resistance
itself. If the sensual propensity is small, the effort is
small. The latter is <i>made great</i> by the presence of a great
antagonist to overcome. And if a brief definition of ideal
or moral action were required, none could be given which
would better fit the appearances than this: <i>It is action in
the line of the greatest resistance.</i>.</p>

<p>The facts may be most briefly symbolized thus, P standing
for the propensity, I for the ideal impulse, and E for
the effort:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I <i>per se</i> &lt; P.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I + E &gt; P.</span><br />
</p>

<p>In other words, if E adds itself to I, P immediately
offers the least resistance, and motion occurs in spite of it.</p>

<p>But the E does not seem to form an integral part of the
I. It appears adventitious and indeterminate in advance.
We can make more or less as we please, and <i>if</i> we make
enough we can convert the greatest mental resistance into
the least. Such, at least, is the impression which the facts
spontaneously produce upon us. But we will not discuss
the truth of this impression at present; let us rather continue
our descriptive detail.</p>


<h4>PLEASURE AND PAIN AS SPRINGS OF ACTION.</h4>


<p>Objects and thoughts of objects start our action, but
the pleasures and pains which action brings modify its
course and regulate it; and later the thoughts of the pleasures
and the pains acquire themselves impulsive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
inhibitive power. Not that the thought of a pleasure need
be itself a pleasure, usually it is the reverse&mdash;<i>nessun maggior
dolore</i>&mdash;as Dante says&mdash;and not that the thought of pain
need be a pain, for, as Homer says, "griefs are often afterwards
an entertainment." But as present pleasures are
tremendous reinforcers, and present pains tremendous inhibitors
of whatever action leads to them, so the thoughts
of pleasures and pains take rank amongst the thoughts
which have most impulsive and inhibitive power. The
precise relation which these thoughts hold to other thoughts
is thus a matter demanding some attention.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If a movement feels agreeable, we repeat and repeat it
as long as the pleasure lasts. If it hurts us, our muscular
contractions at the instant stop. So complete is the inhibition
in this latter case that it is almost impossible for a
man to cut or mutilate himself slowly and deliberately&mdash;his
hand invincibly refusing to bring on the pain. And there
are many pleasures which, when once we have begun to
taste them, make it all but obligatory to keep up the activity
to which they are due. So widespread and searching
is this influence of pleasures and pains upon our movements
that a premature philosophy has decided that these are
our only spurs to action, and that wherever they seem to
be absent, it is only because they are so far on among the
'remoter' images that prompt the action that they are overlooked.</p>

<p>This is a great mistake, however. Important as is the
influence of pleasures and pains upon our movements, they
are far from being our only stimuli. With the manifestations
of instinct and emotional expression, for example, they
have absolutely nothing to do. Who smiles for the pleasure
of the smiling, or frowns for the pleasure of the frown?
Who blushes to escape the discomfort of not blushing?
Or who in anger, grief, or fear is actuated to the movements
which he makes by the pleasures which they yield? In all
these cases the movements are discharged fatally by the
<i>vis a tergo</i> which the stimulus exerts upon a nervous system
framed to respond in just that way. The objects of our
rage, love, or terror, the occasions of our tears and smiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
whether they be present to our senses, or whether they be
merely represented in idea, have this peculiar sort of impulsive
power. The <i>impulsive quality</i> of mental states is an
attribute behind which we cannot go. Some states of mind
have more of it than others, some have it in this direction,
and some in that. Feelings of pleasure and pain have it,
and perceptions and imaginations of fact have it, but neither
have it exclusively or peculiarly. It is of the essence of all
consciousness (or of the neural process which underlies it)
to instigate movement of some sort. That with one creature
and object it should be of one sort, with others of another
sort, is a problem for evolutionary history to explain.
However the actual impulsions may have arisen, they must
now be described as they exist; and those persons obey a
curiously narrow teleological superstition who think themselves
bound to interpret them in every instance as effects
of the secret solicitancy of pleasure and repugnancy of
pain.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span></p>
<p>It might be that to <i>reflection</i> such a narrow teleology
would justify itself, that pleasures and pains might seem
the only <i>comprehensible and reasonable</i> motives for action, the
only motives on which we <i>ought</i> to act. That is an <i>ethical</i>
proposition, in favor of which a good deal may be said.
But it is not a <i>psychological</i> proposition; and nothing follows
from it as to the motives upon which as a matter of
fact we <i>do</i> act. These motives are supplied by innumerable
objects, which innervate our voluntary muscles by a process
as automatic as that by which they light a fever in our
breasts. If the thought of pleasure can impel to action,
surely other thoughts may. Experience only can decide
which thoughts do. The chapters on Instinct and Emotion
have shown us that their name is legion; and with this
verdict we ought to remain contented, and not seek an illusory
simplification at the cost of half the facts.</p>

<p>If in these our <i>first</i> acts pleasures and pains bear no
part, as little do they bear in our last acts, or those artificially
acquired performances which have become habitual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
All the daily routine of life, our dressing and undressing,
the coming and going from our work or carrying
through of its various operations, is utterly without mental
reference to pleasure and pain, except under rarely realized
conditions. It is ideo-motor action. As I do not breathe
for the pleasure of the breathing, but simply find that I <i>am</i>
breathing, so I do not write for the pleasure of the writing,
but simply because I have once begun, and being in a
state of intellectual excitement which keeps venting itself
in that way, find that I <i>am</i> writing still. Who will pretend
that when he idly fingers his knife-handle at the table, it is
for the sake of any pleasure which it gives him, or pain
which he thereby avoids. We do all these things because
at the moment we cannot help it; our nervous systems are
so shaped that they overflow in just that way; and for
many of our idle or purely 'nervous' and fidgety performances
we can assign absolutely no <i>reason</i> at all.</p>

<p>Or what shall be said of a shy and unsociable man who
receives point-blank an invitation to a small party? The
thing is to him an abomination; but your presence exerts
a compulsion on him, he can think of no excuse, and so
says yes, cursing himself the while for what he does. He
is unusually <i>sui compos</i> who does not every week of his
life fall into some such blundering act as this. Such instances
of <i>voluntas invita</i> show not only that our acts cannot
all be conceived as effects of represented pleasure,
but that they cannot even be classed as cases of represented
<i>good</i>. The class 'goods' contains many more generally
influential motives to action than the class 'pleasants.'
Pleasures often attract us only because we deem
them goods. Mr. Spencer, e.g., urges us to court pleasures
for their influence upon health, which comes to us as a good.
But almost as little as under the form of pleasures do our
acts invariably appear to us under the form of <i>goods</i>. All
diseased impulses and pathological fixed ideas are instances
to the contrary. It is the very badness of the act that gives
it then its vertiginous fascination. Remove the prohibition,
and the attraction stops. In my university days a
student threw himself from an upper entry window of one
of the college buildings and was nearly killed. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
student, a friend of my own, had to pass the window daily in
coming and going from his room, and experienced a dreadful
temptation to imitate the deed. Being a Catholic, he told
his director, who said, 'All right! if you must, you must,'
and added, 'Go ahead and do it,' thereby instantly quenching
his desire. This director knew how to minister to a
mind diseased. But we need not go to minds diseased for
examples of the occasional tempting-power of simple badness
and unpleasantness as such. Every one who has a
wound or hurt anywhere, a sore tooth, e.g., will ever and
anon press it just to bring out the pain. If we are near a
new sort of stink, we must sniff it again just to verify once
more how bad it is. This very day I have been repeating
over and over to myself a verbal jingle whose mawkish
silliness was the secret of its haunting power. I loathed
yet could not banish it.</p>

<p>Believers in the pleasure-and-pain theory must thus,
if they are candid, make large exceptions in the application
of their creed. Action from 'fixed ideas' is accordingly
a terrible stumbling-block to the candid Professor Bain.
Ideas have in his psychology no impulsive but only a 'guiding'
function, whilst</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The proper stimulus of the will, namely, some variety of pleasure
and pain, is needed to give the impetus.... The intellectual link is
not sufficient for causing the deed to rise at the beck of the idea
(except in case of an 'idée fixe');" but "should any <i>pleasure</i> spring
up or be continued, by performing an action that we clearly conceive,
the causation is then complete; both the directing and the moving
powers are present."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Pleasures and pains are for Professor Bain the '<i>genuine</i>
impulses of the will.'<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Without an antecedent of pleasurable or painful feeling&mdash;actual
or ideal, primary or derivative&mdash;the will cannot be stimulated. Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
all the disguises that wrap up what we call motives, something of one
or other of these two grand conditions can be detected."<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Accordingly, where Professor Bain finds an exception to
this rule, he refuses to call the phenomenon a 'genuinely
voluntary impulse.' The exceptions, he admits, 'are those
furnished by never-dying spontaneity, habits, and fixed
ideas.'<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Fixed ideas 'traverse the proper course of volition.'<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Disinterested impulses</i> are wholly distinct from the attainment of
pleasure and the avoidance of pain.... The theory of disinterested
action, in the only form that I can conceive it, supposes that the action
of the will and the attainment of happiness do not square throughout."<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sympathy</i> "has this in common with the Fixed Idea,
that it clashes with the regular outgoings of the will in
favor, of our pleasures."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Prof. Bain thus admits all the essential facts. Pleasure
and pain are motives of only part of our activity. But he
prefers to give to that part of the activity exclusively which
these feelings prompt the name of '<i>regular</i> outgoings' and
'<i>genuine</i> impulses' of the will,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> and to treat all the rest as
mere paradoxes and anomalies, of which nothing rational
can be said. This amounts to taking one species of a
genus, calling it alone by the generic name, and ordering
the other co-ordinate species to find what names they may.
At bottom this is only verbal play. How much more conducive
to clearness and insight it is to take the <i>genus</i>
'springs of action' and treat it as a whole; and then to
distinguish within it the species 'pleasure and pain' from
whatever other species may be found!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is, it is true, a complication in the relation of
pleasure to action, which partly excuses those who make
it the exclusive spur. This complication deserves some
notice at our hands.</p>

<p>An impulse which discharges itself immediately is generally
quite <i>neutral</i> as regards pleasure or pain&mdash;the breathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
impulse, for example. If such an impulse is arrested,
however, by an extrinsic force, a great feeling of <i>uneasiness</i>
is produced&mdash;for instance, the dyspnœa of asthma. And
in proportion as the arresting force is then overcome, <i>relief</i>
accrues&mdash;as when we draw breath again after the asthma subsides.
The relief is a pleasure and the uneasiness a pain;
and thus it happens that round all our impulses, merely as
such, there twine, as it were, secondary possibilities of
pleasant and painful feeling, involved in the manner in
which the act is allowed to occur. These <i>pleasures and
pains of achievement, discharge, or fruition</i> exist, no matter
what the original spring of action be. We are glad when
we have successfully got ourselves out of a danger, though
the thought of the gladness was surely not what suggested
to us to escape. To have compassed the steps towards a
proposed sensual indulgence also makes us glad, and this
gladness is a pleasure additional to the pleasure originally
proposed. On the other hand, we are chagrined and displeased
when any activity, however instigated, is hindered
whilst in process of actual discharge. We are 'uneasy'
till the discharge starts up again. And this is just as true
when the action is neutral, or has nothing but pain in view
as its result, as when it was undertaken for pleasure's express
sake. The moth is probably as annoyed if hindered
from getting into the lamp-flame as the <i>roué</i> is if interrupted
in his debauch; and we are chagrined if prevented
from doing some quite unimportant act which would have
given us no noticeable pleasure if done, merely because the
prevention itself is disagreeable.</p>

<p>Let us now call the pleasure <i>for the sake</i> of which the
act may be done the <i>pursued pleasure</i>. It follows that, even
when no pleasure is pursued by an act, the act itself may be
the <i>pleasantest line</i> of conduct when once the impulse has
begun, on account of the incidental pleasure which then
attends its successful achievement and the pain which would
come of interruption. A <i>pleasant act</i> and an act <i>pursuing a
pleasure</i> are in themselves, however, two perfectly distinct
conceptions, though they coalesce in one concrete phenomenon
whenever a pleasure is deliberately pursued. I cannot
help thinking that it is the <i>confusion of pursued pleasure</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
<i>with mere pleasure of achievement</i> which makes the pleasure-theory
of action so plausible to the ordinary mind. We
feel an impulse, no matter whence derived; we proceed
to act; if hindered, we feel displeasure; and if successful,
relief. Action <i>in the line of the present impulse</i> is always for
the time being the pleasant course; and the ordinary hedonist
expresses this fact by saying that we act for the
<i>sake</i> of the pleasantness involved. But who does not see
that for this sort of pleasure to be possible, <i>the impulse
must be there already as an independent fact?</i> The pleasure
of successful performance is the <i>result</i> of the impulse, not
its <i>cause</i>. You cannot have your pleasure of achievement
unless you have managed to get your impulse under headway
beforehand by some previous means.</p>

<p>It is true that on special occasions (so complex is the
human mind) <i>the pleasure of achievement may itself become a
pursued pleasure;</i> and these cases form another point on which
the pleasure-theory is apt to rally. Take a foot-ball game
or a fox-hunt. Who in cold blood wants the fox for its
own sake, or cares whether the ball be at this goal or that?
We know, however, by experience, that if we can once rouse
a certain impulsive excitement in ourselves, whether to overtake
the fox, or to get the ball to one particular goal, the
successful venting of it over the counteracting checks will
fill us with exceeding joy. We therefore get ourselves deliberately
and artificially into the hot impulsive state. It
takes the presence of various instinct-arousing conditions to
excite it; but little by little, once we are in the field, it
reaches its paroxysm; and we reap the reward of our exertions
in that pleasure of successful achievement which,
far more than the dead fox or the goal-got ball, was the object
we originally pursued. So it often is with duties.
Lots of actions are done with heaviness all through, and
not till they are completed does pleasure emerge, in the joy
of being done with them. Like Hamlet we say of each such
successive task,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"O cursed spite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That ever I was born to set it right!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>and then we often add to the original impulse that set us
on, this additional one, that "we shall feel so glad when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
well through with it," that thought also having its impulsive
spur. But because a pleasure of achievement <i>can</i> thus become
a pursued pleasure upon occasion, it does not follow
that everywhere and always that pleasure must be what is
pursued. This, however, is what the pleasure-philosophers
seem to suppose. As well might they suppose, because no
steamer can go to sea without incidentally consuming coal,
and because some steamers may occasionally go to sea to
<i>try</i> their coal, that therefore no steamer <i>can</i> go to sea for
any other motive than that of coal-consumption.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>As we need not act for the sake of gaining the pleasure of
achievement, so neither need we act for the sake of escaping
the uneasiness of arrest. This uneasiness is altogether due
to the fact that the act is <i>already tending to occur</i> on other
grounds. And these original grounds are what impel to its
continuance, even though the uneasiness of the arrest may
upon occasion add to their impulsive power.</p>

<p>To conclude, I am far from denying the exceeding prominence
and importance of the part which pleasures and
pains, both felt and represented, play in the motivation of
our conduct. But I must insist that it is no exclusive part,
and that co-ordinately with these mental objects innumerable
others have an exactly similar impulsive and inhibitive
power.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>If one must have a single name for the condition upon
which the impulsive and inhibitive quality of objects depends,
one had better call it their <i>interest</i>. 'The interesting'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
is a title which covers not only the pleasant and the
painful, but also the morbidly fascinating, the tediously
haunting, and even the simply habitual, inasmuch as the
attention usually travels on habitual lines, and what-we-attend-to
and what-interests-us are synonymous terms. It
seems as if we ought to look for the secret of an idea's impulsiveness,
not in any peculiar relations which it may have
with paths of motor discharge,&mdash;for <i>all</i> ideas have relations
with some such paths,&mdash;but rather in a preliminary phenomenon,
the <i>urgency, namely, with which it is able to compel
attention and dominate in consciousness.</i> Let it once so dominate,
let no other ideas succeed in displacing it, and whatever
motor effects belong to it by nature will inevitably
occur&mdash;its impulsion, in short, will be given to boot, and will
manifest itself as a matter of course. This is what we have
seen in instinct, in emotion, in common ideo-motor action,
in hypnotic suggestion, in morbid impulsion, and in <i>voluntas
invita</i>,&mdash;the impelling idea is simply the one which possesses
the attention. It is the same where pleasure and pain are
the motor spurs&mdash;they drive other thoughts from consciousness
at the same time that they instigate their own
characteristic 'volitional' effects. And this is also what
happens at the moment of the <i>fiat</i>, in all the five types of
'decision' which we have described. In short, one does not
see any case in which the steadfast occupancy of consciousness
does not appear to be the prime condition of impulsive
power. It is still more obviously the prime condition of
inhibitive power. What checks our impulses is the mere
thinking of reasons to the contrary&mdash;it is their bare presence
to the mind which gives the veto, and makes acts, otherwise
seductive, impossible to perform. If we could only <i>forget</i>
our scruples, our doubts, our fears, what exultant energy
we should for a while display!</p>


<h4>WILL IS A RELATION BETWEEN THE MIND AND ITS
'IDEAS.'</h4>


<p>In closing in, therefore, after all these preliminaries,
upon the more <i>intimate</i> nature of the volitional process, we
find ourselves driven more and more exclusively to consider
the conditions which make ideas prevail in the mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
With the prevalence, once there as a fact, of the motive
idea the <i>psychology</i> of volition properly stops. The movements
which ensue are exclusively physiological phenomena,
following according to physiological laws upon the neural
events to which the idea corresponds. The <i>willing</i> terminates
with the prevalence of the idea; and whether the act
then follows or not is a matter quite immaterial, so far as the
willing itself goes. I will to write, and the act follows. I
will to sneeze, and it does not. I will that the distant table
slide over the floor towards me; it also does not. My willing
representation can no more instigate my sneezing-centre
than it can instigate the table to activity. But in both cases
it is as true and good willing as it was when I willed to
write.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> In a word, volition is a psychic or moral fact pure
and simple, and is absolutely completed when the stable
state of the idea is there. The supervention of motion is a
supernumerary phenomenon depending on executive ganglia
whose function lies outside the mind.</p>

<p>In St. Vitus' dance, in locomotor ataxy, the representation
of a movement and the consent to it take place normally.
But the inferior executive centres are deranged, and
although the ideas discharge them, they do not discharge
them so as to reproduce the precise sensations anticipated.
In aphasia the patient has an image of certain words which
he wishes to utter, but when he opens his mouth he hears
himself making quite unintended sounds. This may fill
him with rage and despair&mdash;which passions only show how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
intact his will remains. Paralysis only goes a step farther.
The associated mechanism is not only deranged but altogether
broken through. The volition occurs, but the
hand remains as still as the table. The paralytic is made
aware of this by the absence of the expected change in his
afferent sensations. He tries harder, i.e., he mentally
frames the sensation of muscular 'effort,' with consent that
it shall occur. It does so: he frowns, he heaves his chest,
he clinches his other fist, but the palsied arm lies passive
as before.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>We thus find that <i>we reach the heart of our inquiry into
volition when we ask by what process it is that the thought of
any given object comes to prevail stably in the mind.</i> Where
thoughts prevail without effort, we have sufficiently studied
in the several chapters on sensation, association, and attention,
the laws of their advent before consciousness and of
their stay. We will not go over that ground again, for we
know that interest and association are the words, let their
worth be what it may, on which our explanations must perforce
rely. Where, on the other hand, the prevalence of
the thought is accompanied by the phenomenon of effort,
the case is much less clear. Already in the chapter on attention
we postponed the final consideration of voluntary
attention with effort to a later place. We have now
brought things to a point at which we see that attention
with effort is all that any case of volition implies. <i>The
essential achievement of the will, in short, when it is most 'voluntary,'
is to</i> <span class="smcap">attend</span> <i>to a difficult object and hold it fast before
the mind.</i> The so-doing <i>is</i> the <i>fiat</i>; and it is a mere physiological
incident that when the object is thus attended to,
immediate motor consequences should ensue. A <i>resolve</i>,
whose contemplated motor consequences are not to ensue
until some possibly far distant future condition shall have
been fulfilled, involves all the psychic elements of a motor
fiat except the word '<i>now</i>;' and it is the same with many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
our purely theoretic beliefs. We saw in effect in the appropriate
chapter, how in the last resort belief means only
a peculiar sort of occupancy of the mind, and relation to
the self felt in the thing believed; and we know in the case
of many beliefs how constant an effort of the attention is
required to keep them in this situation and protect them
from displacement by contradictory ideas.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> (Compare
above, <a href="#Page_321">p. 321</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Effort of attention is thus the essential phenomenon of
will.</i><a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Every reader must know by his own experience that
this is so, for every reader must have felt some fiery passion's
grasp. What constitutes the difficulty for a man
laboring under an unwise passion of acting as if the passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
were unwise? Certainly there is no physical difficulty. It
is as easy physically to avoid a fight as to begin one, to
pocket one's money as to squander it on one's cupidities, to
walk away from as towards a coquette's door. The difficulty
is mental; it is that of getting the idea of the wise action
to stay before our mind at all. When any strong emotional
state whatever is upon us the tendency is for no images but
such as are congruous with it to come up. If others by
chance offer themselves, they are instantly smothered and
crowded out. If we be joyous, we cannot keep thinking of
those uncertainties and risks of failure which abound upon
our path; if lugubrious, we cannot think of new triumphs,
travels, loves, and joys; nor if vengeful, of our oppressor's
community of nature with ourselves. The cooling advice
which we get from others when the fever-fit is on us is the
most jarring and exasperating thing in life. Reply we cannot,
so we get angry; for by a sort of self-preserving instinct
which our passion has, it feels that these chill objects,
if they once but gain a lodgment, will work and work
until they have frozen the very vital spark from out of all
our mood and brought our airy castles in ruin to the ground.
Such is the inevitable effect of reasonable ideas over others&mdash;<i>if
they can once get a quiet hearing;</i> and passion's cue
accordingly is always and everywhere to prevent their still
small voice from being heard at all. "Let me not think of
that! Don't speak to me of that!" This is the sudden cry
of all those who in a passion perceive some sobering considerations
about to check them in mid-career. "<i>Hæc tibi
erit janua leti</i>," we feel. There is something so icy in this
cold-water bath, something which seems so hostile to the
movement of our life, so purely negative, in Reason, when
she lays her corpse-like finger on our heart and says, "Halt!
give up! leave off! go back! sit down!" that it is no wonder
that to most men the steadying influence seems, for the
time being, a very minister of death.</p>

<p>The strong-willed man, however, is the man who hears
the still small voice unflinchingly, and who, when the
death-bringing consideration comes, looks at its face, consents
to its presence, clings to it, affirms it, and holds it
fast, in spite of the host of exciting mental images which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
rise in revolt against it and would expel it from the mind.
Sustained in this way by a resolute effort of attention, the
difficult object erelong begins to call up its own congeners
and associates and ends by changing the disposition of the
man's consciousness altogether. And with his consciousness,
his action changes, for the new object, once stably in
possession of the field of his thoughts, infallibly produces
its own motor effects. The difficulty lies in the gaining
possession of that field. Though the spontaneous drift of
thought is all the other way, the attention must be kept
strained on that one object until at last it <i>grows</i>, so as to
maintain itself before the mind with ease. This strain of
the attention is the fundamental act of will. And the will's
work is in most cases practically ended when the bare presence
to our thought of the naturally unwelcome object has
been secured. For the mysterious tie between the thought
and the motor centres next comes into play, and, in a way
which we cannot even guess at, the obedience of the bodily
organs follows as a matter of course.</p>

<p>In all this one sees how the immediate point of application
of the volitional effort lies exclusively in the mental
world. The whole drama is a mental drama. The whole
difficulty is a mental difficulty, a difficulty with an object of
our thought. If I may use the word <i>idea</i> without suggesting
associationist or Herbartian fables, I will say that it is
an idea to which our will applies itself, an idea which if we
let it go would slip away, but which we will not let go.
Consent to the idea's undivided presence, this is effort's
sole achievement. Its only function is to get this feeling of
consent into the mind. And for this there is but one way.
The idea to be consented to must be kept from flickering
and going out. It must be held steadily before the mind
until it <i>fills</i> the mind. Such filling of the mind by an idea,
with its congruous associates, <i>is</i> consent to the idea and to
the fact which the idea represents. If the idea be that, or
include that, of a bodily movement of our own, then we call
the consent thus laboriously gained a motor volition. For
Nature here 'backs' us instantaneously and follows up our
inward willingness by outward changes on her own part.
She does this in no other instance. Pity she should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
have been more generous, nor made a world whose other
parts were as immediately subject to our will!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On <a href="#Page_531">page 531</a>, in describing the 'reasonable type' of decision,
it was said that it usually came when the right conception
of the case was found. Where, however, the right
conception is an anti-inpulsive one, the whole intellectual
ingenuity of the man usually goes to work to crowd it out
of sight, and to find names for the emergency, by the help
of which the dispositions of the moment may sound sanctified,
and sloth or passion may reign unchecked. How many
excuses does the drunkard find when each new temptation
comes! It is a new brand of liquor which the interests of
intellectual culture in such matters oblige him to test;
moreover it is poured out and it is sin to waste it; or others
are drinking and it would be churlishness to refuse; or it is
but to enable him to sleep, or just to get through this job of
work; or it isn't drinking, it is because he feels so cold;
or it is Christmas-day; or it is a means of stimulating him
to make a more powerful resolution in favor of abstinence
than any he has hitherto made; or it is just this once, and
once doesn't count, etc., etc., <i>ad libitum</i>&mdash;it is, in fact, anything
you like except <i>being a drunkard. That</i> is the conception
that will not stay before the poor soul's attention. But
if he once gets able to pick out that way of conceiving, from
all the other possible ways of conceiving the various opportunities
which occur, if through thick and thin he holds
to it that this is being a drunkard and is nothing else, he
is not likely to remain one long. The effort by which he
succeeds in keeping the right <i>name</i> unwaveringly present
to his mind proves to be his saving moral act.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>Everywhere then the function of the effort is the same:
to keep affirming and adopting a thought which, if left to
itself, would slip away. It may be cold and flat when the
spontaneous mental drift is towards excitement, or great
and arduous when the spontaneous drift is towards repose.
In the one case the effort has to inhibit an explosive, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
other to arouse an obstructed will. The exhausted sailor
on a wreck has a will which is obstructed. One of his
ideas is that of his sore hands, of the nameless exhaustion
of his whole frame which the act of farther pumping involves,
and of the deliciousness of sinking into sleep. The
other is that of the hungry sea ingulfing him. "Rather
the aching toil!" he says; and it becomes reality then, in
spite of the inhibiting influence of the relatively luxurious
sensations which he gets from lying still. But exactly
similar in form would be his consent to lie and sleep. Often
it is the thought of sleep and what leads to it which is the
hard one to keep before the mind. If a patient afflicted
with insomnia can only control the whirling chase of his
thoughts so far as to think of <i>nothing at all</i> (which can be
done), or so far as to imagine one letter after another of a
verse of scripture or poetry spelt slowly and monotonously
out, it is almost certain that here, too, specific bodily effects
will follow, and that sleep will come. The trouble is to keep
the mind upon a train of objects naturally so insipid. <i>To
sustain a representation, to think,</i> is, in short, the only moral
act, for the impulsive and the obstructed, for sane and
lunatics alike. Most maniacs know their thoughts to be
crazy, but find them too pressing to be withstood. Compared
with them the sane truths are so deadly sober, so
cadaverous, that the lunatic cannot bear to look them in
the face and say, "Let these alone be my reality!" But
with sufficient effort, as Dr. Wigan says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Such a man can for a time <i>wind himself up</i>, as it were, and determine
that the notions of the disordered brain shall not be manifested.
Many instances are on record similar to that told by Pinel, where an
inmate of the Bicêtre, having stood a long cross-examination, and
given every mark of restored reason, signed his name to the paper
authorizing his discharge 'Jesus Christ,' and then went off into all the
vagaries connected with that delusion. In the phraseology of the
gentleman whose case is related in an early part of this [Wigan's] work
he had 'held himself tight' during the examination in order to attain
his object; this once accomplished he 'let himself down' again, and,
if even <i>conscious</i> of his delusion, could not control it. I have observed
with such persons that it requires a considerable time to wind themselves
up to the pitch of complete self-control, that the effort is a painful
tension of the mind.... When thrown off their guard by any
accidental remark or worn out by the length of the examination, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
<i>let themselves go</i>, and cannot gather themselves up again without preparation.
Lord Erskine relates the story of a man who brought an
action against Dr. Munro for confining him without cause. He underwent
the most rigid examination by the counsel for the defendant without
discovering any appearance of insanity, till a gentleman asked him
about a princess with whom he corresponded in cherry-juice, and he
became instantly insane."<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To sum it all up in a word, <i>the terminus of the psychological
process in volition, the point to which the will is directly applied,
is always an idea.</i> There are at all times <i>some</i> ideas
from which we shy away like frightened horses the moment
we get a glimpse of their forbidding profile upon the
threshold of our thought. <i>The only resistance which our
will can possibly experience is the resistance which such an idea
offers to being attended to at all.</i> To attend to it is the volitional
act, and the only inward volitional act which we ever
perform.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have put the thing in this ultra-simple way because I
want more than anything else to emphasize the fact that
volition is primarily a relation, not between our Self and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
extra-mental matter (as many philosophers still maintain)
but between our Self and our own states of mind. But
when, a short while ago, I spoke of the filling of the mind
with an idea as being equivalent to consent to the idea's
object, I said something which the reader doubtless questioned
at the time, and which certainly now demands some
qualification ere we pass beyond.</p>

<p>It is unqualifiedly true that if any thought <i>do</i> fill the
mind exclusively, such filling is consent. The thought, for
that time at any rate, carries the man and his will with it.
But it is not true that the thought <i>need</i> fill the mind exclusively
for consent to be there; for we often consent to
things whilst thinking of other things, even of hostile
things; and we saw in fact that precisely what distinguishes
our 'fifth type' of decision from the other types (see <a href="#Page_534">p. 534</a>)
is just this coexistence with the triumphant thought of
other thoughts which would inhibit it but for the effort
which makes it prevail. The effort to <i>attend</i> is therefore
only a part of what the word 'will' covers; it covers also
the effort to <i>consent</i> to something to which our attention is
not quite complete. Often, when an object has gained our
attention exclusively, and its motor results are just on the
point of setting in, it seems as if the sense of their imminent
irrevocability were enough of itself to start up the inhibitory
ideas and to make us pause. Then we need a new
stroke of effort to break down the sudden hesitation which
seizes upon us, and to persevere. So that although attention
is the first and fundamental thing in volition, <i>express
consent to the reality of what is attended to</i> is often an additional
and quite distinct phenomenon involved.</p>

<p>The reader's own consciousness tells him of course just
what these words of mine denote. And I freely confess
that I am impotent to carry the analysis of the matter any
farther, or to explain in other terms of what this consent
consists. It seems a subjective experience <i>sui generis</i>, which
we can designate but not define. We stand here exactly
where we did in the case of belief. When an idea <i>stings</i> us
in a certain way, makes as it were a certain electric connection
with our self, we believe that it <i>is</i> a reality. When it
stings us in another way, makes another connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
our Self, we say, <i>let it be</i> a reality. To the word 'is' and
to the words 'let it be' there correspond peculiar attitudes
of consciousness which it is vain to seek to explain. The
indicative and the imperative moods are as much ultimate
categories of thinking as they are of grammar. The 'quality
of reality' which these moods attach to things is not
like other qualities. It is a relation to our life. It means
<i>our</i> adoption of the things, <i>our</i> caring for them, <i>our</i> standing
by them. This at least is what it practically means for
us; what it may mean beyond that we do not know.
And the transition from merely considering an object as
possible, to deciding or willing it to be real; the change
from the fluctuating to the stable personal attitude concerning
it; from the 'don't care' state of mind to that in which
'we mean business,' is one of the most familiar things in
life. We can partly enumerate its conditions; and we can
partly trace its consequences, especially the momentous
one that when the mental object is a movement of our own
body, it realizes itself outwardly when the mental change
in question has occurred. But the change itself as a subjective
phenomenon is something which we can translate
into no simpler terms.</p>


<h4>THE QUESTION OF 'FREE-WILL.'</h4>

<p>Especially must we, when talking about it, rid our mind
of the fabulous warfare of separate agents called 'ideas.'
The brain-processes may be agents, and the thought as such
may be an agent. But what the ordinary psychologies
call 'ideas' are nothing but parts of the total <i>object</i> of
representation. All that is before the mind at once, no
matter how complex a system of things and relations it may
be, is one object for the thought. Thus,
'A-and-B-and-their-mutual-incompatibility-and-the-fact-that-only-one-can-be-true-or-can-become-real-notwithstanding-the-probability-or-desirability-of-both'
may be such a complex object;
and where the thought is deliberative its object has always
some such form as this. When, now, we pass from deliberation
to decision, that total object undergoes a change.
We either dismiss A altogether and its relations to B, and
think of B exclusively; or after thinking of both as possibilities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
we next think that A is impossible, and that B is
or forthwith shall be real. In either case a <i>new</i> object is
before our thought; and where effort exists, it is where
the change from the first object to the second one is hard.
Our thought seems to turn in this case like a heavy door
on rusty hinges; only, so far as the effort feels spontaneous,
it turns, not as if by some one helping, but as if by an
inward activity, born for the occasion, of its own.</p>

<p>The psychologists who discussed 'the muscular sense'
at the international congress at Paris in 1889 agreed at the
end that they needed to come to a better understanding
in regard to this appearance of internal activity at the
moment when a decision is made. M. Fouillée, in an article
which I find more interesting and suggestive than coherent
or conclusive,<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> seems to resolve our sense of activity into
that of our very <i>existence as thinking entities</i>. At least so
I translate his words.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> But we saw in Chapter X how hard
it is to lay a verifying finger plainly upon the thinking
process as such, and to distinguish it from certain objects
of the stream. M. Fouillée admits this; but I do not think
he fully realizes how strong would be the position of a man
who should suggest (see Vol. I. p. 301) that the feeling of
moral activity itself which accompanies the advent of certain
'objects' before the mind is nothing but certain other
objects,&mdash;constrictions, namely, in the brows, eyes, throat,
and breathing apparatus, present then, but absent from
other pulses of subjective change. Were this the truth,
then a part, at any rate, of the activity of which we become
aware in effort would seem merely to be that of our body;
and many thinkers would probably thereupon conclude
that this 'settles the claims' of inner activity, and dismisses
the whole notion of such a thing as a superfluity in psychological
science.</p>

<p>I cannot see my way to so extreme a view; even although
I must repeat the confession made on pp. 296-7 of
Vol. I, that I do not <i>fully</i> understand how we come to our
unshakable belief that thinking exists as a special kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
immaterial process alongside of the material processes of the
world. It is certain, however, that only by <i>postulating</i> such
thinking do we make things currently intelligible; and it is
certain that no psychologist has as yet denied the <i>fact</i> of
thinking, the utmost that has been denied being its dynamic
power. But if we postulate the fact of the thinking at all,
I believe that we must postulate its power as well; nor do
I see how we can rightly equalize its power with its mere
existence, and say (as M. Fouillée seems to say) that for the
thought-process to <i>go on at all</i> is an activity, and an activity
everywhere the same; for certain steps forward in this
process seem <i>prima facie</i> to be passive, and other steps
(as where an object comes with effort) seem <i>prima facie</i> to
be active in a supreme degree. If we admit, therefore, that
our thoughts <i>exist</i>, we ought to admit that they exist after
the fashion in which they appear, as things, namely, that
supervene upon each other, sometimes with effort and sometimes
with ease; the only questions being, is the effort
where it exists a fixed function of the <i>object</i>, which the latter
imposes on the thought? or is it such an independent
'variable' that with a constant object more or less of it
may be made?</p>

<p>It certainly appears to us indeterminate, and as if, even
with an unchanging object, we might make more or less, as
we choose. If it be really indeterminate, our future acts are
ambiguous or unpredestinate: in common parlance, <i>our
wills are free</i>. If the amount of effort be not indeterminate,
but be related in a fixed manner to the objects themselves,
in such wise that whatever object at any time fills our
consciousness was from eternity bound to fill it then and
there, and compel from us the exact effort, neither more nor
less, which we bestow upon it,&mdash;then our wills are not free,
and all our acts are foreordained. <i>The question of fact in
the free-will controversy is thus extremely simple.</i> It relates
solely to the amount of effort of attention or consent which
we can at any time put forth. Are the duration and intensity
of this effort fixed functions of the object, or are they not?
Now, as I just said, it <i>seems</i> as if the effort were an independent
variable, as if we might exert more or less of it in
any given case. When a man has let his thoughts go for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
days and weeks until at last they culminate in some particularly
dirty or cowardly or cruel act, it is hard to persuade
him, in the midst of his remorse, that he might not
have reined them in; hard to make him believe that this
whole goodly universe (which his act so jars upon) required
and exacted it of him at that fatal moment, and from eternity
made aught else impossible. But, on the other hand, there
is the certainty that all his <i>effortless</i> volitions are resultants
of interests and associations whose strength and sequence are
mechanically determined by the structure of that physical
mass, his brain; and the general continuity of things and
the monistic conception of the world may lead one irresistibly
to postulate that a little fact like effort can form no
real exception to the overwhelming reign of deterministic
law. Even in effortless volition we have the consciousness
of the alternative being also possible. This is surely a delusion
here; why is it not a delusion everywhere?</p>

<p>My own belief is that the question of free-will is insoluble
on strictly psychologic grounds. After a certain
amount of effort of attention has been given to an idea, it
is manifestly impossible to tell whether either more or less
of it <i>might</i> have been given or not. To tell that, we should
have to ascend to the antecedents of the effort, and defining
them with mathematical exactitude, prove, by laws of
which we have not at present even an inkling, that the
only amount of sequent effort which could <i>possibly</i> comport
with them was the precise amount which actually came.
Measurements, whether of psychic or of neural quantities,
and deductive reasonings such as this method of proof implies,
will surely be forever beyond human reach. No serious
psychologist or physiologist will venture even to suggest
a notion of how they might be practically made. We
are thrown back therefore upon the crude evidences of introspection
on the one hand, with all its liabilities to deception,
and, on the other hand, upon <i>a priori</i> postulates
and probabilities. He who loves to balance nice doubts
need be in no hurry to decide the point. Like Mephistopheles
to Faust, he can say to himself, "<i>dazu hast du noch
eine lange Frist</i>," for from generation to generation the
reasons adduced on both sides will grow more voluminous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
and the discussion more refined. But if our speculative
delight be less keen, if the love of a <i>parti pris</i> outweighs
that of keeping questions open, or if, as a French philosopher
of genius says, "<i>l'amour de la vie qui s'indigne de tant
de discours</i>," awakens in us, craving the sense of either
peace or power,&mdash;then, taking the risk of error on our head,
we must project upon one of the alternative views the
attribute of reality for us; we must so fill our mind with
the idea of it that it becomes our settled creed. The
present writer does this for the alternative of freedom, but
since the grounds of his opinion are ethical rather than
psychological, he prefers to exclude them from the present
book.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A few words, however, may be permitted about the
logic of the question. The most that any argument can do
for determinism is to make it a clear and seductive conception,
which a man is foolish not to espouse, so long as he
stands by the great scientific postulate that the world must
be one unbroken fact, and that prediction of all things
without exception must be ideally, even if not actually,
possible. It is a <i>moral</i> postulate about the Universe, the
postulate that <i>what ought to be can be, and that bad acts
cannot be fated, but that good ones must be possible in their
place,</i> which would lead one to espouse the contrary
view. But when scientific and moral postulates war thus
with each other and objective proof is not to be had, the
only course is voluntary choice, for scepticism itself, if systematic,
is also voluntary choice. If, meanwhile, the will
<i>be</i> undetermined, it would seem only fitting that the belief
in its indetermination should be voluntarily chosen from
amongst other possible beliefs. Freedom's first deed should
be to affirm itself. We ought never to hope for any other
method of getting at the truth if indeterminism be a fact.
Doubt of this particular truth will therefore probably be
open to us to the end of time, and the utmost that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
believer in free-will can <i>ever</i> do will be to show that the
deterministic arguments are not coercive. That they are
seductive, I am the last to deny; nor do I deny that effort
may be needed to keep the faith in freedom, when they
press upon it, upright in the mind.</p>

<p>There is a <i>fatalistic argument</i> for determinism, however,
which is radically vicious. When a man has let himself
go time after time, he easily becomes impressed with the
enormously preponderating influence of circumstances,
hereditary habits, and temporary bodily dispositions over
what might seem a spontaneity born for the occasion.
"All is fate," he then says; "all is resultant of what pre-exists.
Even if the moment seems original, it is but the
instable molecules passively tumbling in their preappointed
way. It is hopeless to resist the drift, vain to look for any
new force coming in; and less, perhaps, than anywhere else
under the sun is there anything really mine in the decisions
which I make." This is really no argument for simple
determinism. There runs throughout it the sense of a force
which might make things otherwise from one moment to
another, if it were only strong enough to breast the tide. A
person who feels the <i>impotence</i> of free effort in this way has
the acutest notion of what is meant by it, and of its possible
independent power. How else could he be so conscious of
its absence and of that of its effects? But genuine determinism
occupies a totally different ground; not the <i>impotence</i>
but the <i>unthinkability</i> of free-will is what it affirms.
It admits something phenomenal <i>called</i> free effort, which
<i>seems</i> to breast the tide, but it claims this as a <i>portion of the
tide</i>. The variations of the effort cannot be independent, it
says; they cannot originate <i>ex nihilo</i>, or come from a fourth
dimension; they are mathematically fixed functions of the
ideas themselves, which are the tide. Fatalism, which
conceives of effort clearly enough as an independent variable
that might come from a fourth dimension if it <i>would</i>
come, but that does <i>not</i> come, is a very dubious ally for
determinism. It strongly imagines that very possibility
which determinism denies.</p>

<p>But what, quite as much as the inconceivability of
absolutely independent variables, persuades modern men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
of science that their efforts must be predetermined, is the
continuity of the latter with other phenomena whose predetermination
no one doubts. Decisions with effort merge
so gradually into those without it that it is not easy to say
where the limit lies. Decisions without effort merge again
into ideo-motor, and these into reflex acts; so that the
temptation is almost irresistible to throw the formula
which covers so many cases over absolutely all. Where
there is effort just as where there is none, the ideas themselves
which furnish the matter of deliberation are brought
before the mind by the machinery of association. And
this machinery is essentially a system of arcs and paths,
a reflex system, whether effort be amongst its incidents or
not. The reflex way is, after all, the universal way of
conceiving the business. The feeling of <i>ease</i> is a passive
result of the way in which the thoughts unwind themselves.
Why is not the feeling of effort the same? Professor
Lipps, in his admirably clear deterministic statement, so
far from admitting that the feeling of effort testifies to an
increment of force exerted, explains it as a sign that force
is lost. We speak of effort, according to him, whenever a
force expends itself (wholly or partly) in neutralizing
another force, and so fails of its own possible outward
effect. The outward effect of the antagonistic force, however,
also fails in corresponding measure, "so that there is
no effort without counter-effort,... and effort and counter-effort
signify only that causes are mutually robbing
each other of effectiveness."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Where the forces are ideas,
both sets of them, strictly speaking, are the seat of effort&mdash;both
those which tend to explode, and those which tend to
check them. We, however, call the more abundant mass
of ideas <i>ourselves</i>; and, talking of its effort as <i>our</i> effort, and
of that of the smaller mass of ideas as the <i>resistance</i>,<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> we
say that our effort sometimes overcomes the resistances
offered by the inertias of an obstructed, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
those presented by the impulsions of an explosive, will.
Really both effort and resistance are ours, and the identification
of our <i>self</i> with one of these factors is an illusion
and a trick of speech. I do not see how anyone can fail
(especially when the mythologic dynamism of separate
'ideas,' which Professor Lipps cleaves to, is translated into
that of brain-processes) to recognize the fascinating simplicity
of some such view as his. Nor do I see why
<i>for scientific purposes</i> one need give it up even if indeterminate
amounts of effort really do occur. Before their indeterminism,
science simply <i>stops</i>. She can abstract from it
altogether, then; for in the impulses and inhibitions with
which the effort has to cope there is already a larger field
of uniformity than she can ever practically cultivate. Her
prevision will never foretell, even if the effort be completely
predestinate, the actual way in which each individual emergency
is resolved. Psychology will be Psychology,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> and
Science Science, as much as ever (as much and no more)
in this world, whether free will be true in it or not. Science,
however, must be constantly reminded that her purposes
are not the only purposes, and that the order of uniform
causation which she has use for, and is therefore right in
postulating, may be enveloped in a wider order, on which
she has no claims at all.</p>

<p>We can therefore leave the free-will question altogether
out of our account. As we said in Chapter VI (vol. I. p. 453),
the operation of free effort, if it existed, could only be to
hold some one ideal object, or part of an object, a little
longer or a little more intensely before the mind. Amongst
the alternatives which present themselves as <i>genuine possibles</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
it would thus make one effective.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> And although such
quickening of one idea might be <i>morally and historically
momentous</i>, yet, if considered <i>dynamically</i>, it would be an
operation amongst those physiological infinitesimals which
calculation must forever neglect.</p>

<p>But whilst eliminating the question about the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
our effort as one which psychology will never have a practical
call to decide, I must say one word about the extraordinarily
intimate and important character which the
phenomenon of effort assumes in our own eyes as individual
men. Of course we measure ourselves by many standards.
Our strength and our intelligence, our wealth and
even our good luck, are things which warm our heart and
make us feel ourselves a match for life. But deeper than
all such things, and able to suffice unto itself without them,
is the sense of the amount of effort which we can put forth.
Those are, after all, but effects, products, and reflections
of the outer world within. But the effort seems to belong
to an altogether different realm, as if it were the substantive
thing which we <i>are</i>, and those were but externals which we
<i>carry</i>. If the 'searching of our heart and reins' be the
purpose of this human drama, then what is sought seems
to be what effort we can make. He who can make none is
but a shadow; he who can make much is a hero. The huge
world that girdles us about puts all sorts of questions to
us, and tests us in all sorts of ways. Some of the tests we
meet by actions that are easy, and some of the questions
we answer in articulately formulated words. But the
deepest question that is ever asked admits of no reply but
the dumb turning of the will and tightening of our heartstrings
as we say, "<i>Yes, I will even have it so!</i>" When
a dreadful object is presented, or when life as a whole
turns up its dark abysses to our view, then the worthless
ones among us lose their hold on the situation altogether,
and either escape from its difficulties by averting
their attention, or if they cannot do that, collapse into
yielding masses of plaintiveness and fear. The effort
required for facing and consenting to such objects is beyond
their power to make. But the heroic mind does
differently. To it, too, the objects are sinister and dreadful,
unwelcome, incompatible with wished-for things. But
it can face them if necessary, without for that losing its
hold upon the rest of life. The world thus finds in the
heroic man its worthy match and mate; and the effort
which he is able to put forth to hold himself erect and
keep his heart unshaken is the direct measure of his worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
and function in the game of human life. He can <i>stand</i> this
Universe. He can meet it and keep up his faith in it in
presence of those same features which lay his weaker brethren
low. He can still find a zest in it, not by 'ostrich-like
forgetfulness,' but by pure inward willingness to face the
world with those deterrent objects there. And hereby he
becomes one of the masters and the lords of life. He must
be counted with henceforth; he forms a part of human
destiny. Neither in the theoretic nor in the practical
sphere do we care for, or go for help to, those who have
no head for risks, or sense for living on the perilous edge.
Our religious life lies more, our practical life lies less, than
it used to, on the perilous edge. But just as our courage
is so often a reflex of another's courage, so our faith is apt
to be, as Max Müller somewhere says, a faith in some one
else's faith. We draw new life from the heroic example.
The prophet has drunk more deeply than anyone of the cup
of bitterness, but his countenance is so unshaken and he
speaks such mighty words of cheer that his will becomes
our will, and our life is kindled at his own.</p>

<p>Thus not only our morality but our religion, so far as
the latter is deliberate, depend on the effort which we can
make. "<i>Will you or won't you have it so</i>?" is the most probing
question we are ever asked; we are asked it every hour
of the day, and about the largest as well as the smallest,
the most theoretical as well as the most practical, things.
We answer by <i>consents or non-consents</i> and not by words.
What wonder that these dumb responses should seem our
deepest organs of communication with the nature of things!
What wonder if the effort demanded by them be the measure
of our worth as men! What wonder if the amount
which we accord of it be the one strictly underived and
original contribution which we make to the world!</p>


<h4>THE EDUCATION OF THE WILL.</h4>


<p>The education of the will may be taken in a broader or a
narrower sense. In the broader sense, it means the whole
of one's training to moral and prudential conduct, and of
one's learning to adapt means to ends, involving the 'association
of ideas,' in all its varieties and complications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
together with the power of inhibiting impulses irrelevant to
the ends desired, and of initiating movements contributory
thereto. It is the acquisition of these latter powers which
I mean by the education of the will in the narrower sense.
And it is in this sense alone that it is worth while to treat
the matter here.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>Since a willed movement is a movement preceded by an
idea of itself, the problem of the will's education is the problem
of how the idea of a movement can arouse the movement
itself. This, as we have seen, is a secondary kind of
process; for framed as we are, we can have no <i>a priori</i> idea
of a movement, no idea of a movement which we have not
already performed. Before the idea can be generated, the
movement must have occurred in a blind, unexpected way,
and left its idea behind. <i>Reflex, instinctive,</i> or <i>random execution</i>
of a <i>movement</i> must, in other words, precede its voluntary
execution. Reflex and instinctive movements have
already been considered sufficiently for the purposes of this
book. 'Random' movements are mentioned so as to include
<i>quasi</i>-accidental reflexes from inner causes, or
movements possibly arising from such overflow of nutrition
in special centres as Prof. Bain postulates in his explanation
of those 'spontaneous discharges' by which he
sets such great store in his derivation of the voluntary
life.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>Now <i>how can the sensory process which a movement has
previously produced, discharge, when excited again, into the
centre for the movement itself?</i> On the movement's original
occurrence the motor discharge came first and the sensory
process second; now in the voluntary repetition the sensory
process (excited in weak or 'ideational' form) comes
first, and the motor discharge comes second. To tell how
this comes to pass would be to answer the problem of the
education of the will in physiological terms. Evidently the
problem is that of the formation of <i>new paths</i>; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
only thing to do is to make hypotheses, till we find some
which seem to cover all the facts.</p>

<p>How is a fresh path ever formed? All paths are paths
of discharge, and the discharge always takes place in the
direction of least resistance, whether the cell which discharges
be 'motor' or 'sensory.' The <i>connate</i> paths of least
resistance are the paths of instinctive reaction; and I submit
as my first hypothesis that <i>these paths all run one way,
that is from 'sensory' cells into 'motor' cells and from motor
cells into muscles, without ever taking the reverse direction.</i> A
motor cell, for example, never awakens a sensory cell directly,
but only through the incoming current caused by
the bodily movements to which its discharge gives rise.
And a sensory cell <i>always</i> discharges or normally tends to
discharge towards the motor region. Let this direction be
called the 'forward' direction. I call the law an hypothesis,
but really it is an indubitable truth. No impression
or idea of eye, ear, or skin comes to us without occasioning
a movement, even though the movement be no more than
the accommodation of the sense-organ; and all our trains
of sensation and sensational imagery have their terms
alternated and interpenetrated with motor processes, of most
of which we practically are unconscious. Another way of
stating the rule is to say that, primarily or connately, all
currents through the brain run towards the Rolandic region,
and that there they run out, and never return upon
themselves. From this point of view the distinction of
sensory and motor cells has no fundamental significance.
All cells are motor; we simply call those of the Rolandic
region, those nearest the mouth of the funnel, the motor
cells <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

<p>A corollary of this law is that 'sensory' cells do not
awaken each other connately; that is, that no one sensible
property of things has any tendency, in advance of
experience, to awaken in us the idea of any other sensible
properties which in the nature of things may go
with it. <i>There is no a priori calling up of one 'idea' by another;</i>
the only <i>a priori</i> couplings are of ideas with movements.
All suggestions of one sensible fact by another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
take place by secondary paths which experience has
formed.</p>

<p>The diagram (Fig. 87)<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> shows what happens in a nervous
system ideally reduced to the fewest possible terms. A
stimulus reaching the sense-organ awakens the sensory cell,
S; this by the connate or instinctive path discharges the
motor cell, M, which makes the muscle contract; and
the contraction arouses the second sensory cell, K, which
may be the organ either of a 'resident' or 'kinæsthetic,'
or of a 'remote,' sensation. (See above, <a href="#Page_488">p. 488</a>.) This
cell K again discharges into M. If this were the entire
nervous mechanism, the movement, once begun, would
be self-maintaining, and would stop only when the parts were
exhausted. And this, according to M. Pierre Janet, is what
actually happens in <i>catalepsy</i>. A cataleptic patient is anæsthetic,
speechless, motionless. Consciousness, so far as
we can judge, is abolished. Nevertheless the limbs will
retain whatever position is impressed upon them from
without, and retain it so long that if it be a strained and
unnatural position, the phenomenon is regarded by Charcot
as one of the few conclusive tests against hypnotic
subjects shamming, since hypnotics can be made cataleptic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
and then keep their limbs outstretched for a length of
time quite unattainable by the waking will. M. Janet
thinks that in all these cases the outlying ideational
processes in the brain are temporarily thrown out of
gear. The kinæsthetic sensation of the raised arm, for
example, is produced in the patient when the operator
raises the arm, this sensation discharges into the motor cell,
which through the muscle reproduces the sensation, etc.,
the currents running in this closed circle until they grow
so weak, by exhaustion of the parts, that the member slowly
drops. We may call this circle from the muscle to K,
from K to M, and from M to the muscle again, the 'motor
circle.' <i>We should all be cataleptics and never stop a muscular
contraction once begun, were it not that other processes
simultaneously going on inhibit the contraction. Inhibition is
therefore not an occasional accident; it is an essential and unremitting
element of our cerebral life.</i> It is interesting to note
that Dr. Mercier, by a different path of reasoning, is also
led to conclude that we owe to outside inhibitions exclusively
our power to arrest a movement once begun.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>One great inhibitor of the discharge of K into M seems
to be the painful or otherwise displeasing quality of the
sensation itself of K; and conversely, when this sensation
is distinctly pleasant, that fact tends to further K's discharge
into M, and to keep the primordial motor circle
agoing. Tremendous as the part is which pleasure and
pain play in our psychic life, we must confess that absolutely
nothing is known of their cerebral conditions. It is hard
to imagine them as having special centres; it is harder still
to invent peculiar forms of process in each and every centre,
to which these feelings may be due. And let one try as
one will to represent the cerebral activity in exclusively
mechanical terms, I, for one, find it quite impossible to
enumerate what seem to be the facts and yet to make no
mention of the psychic side which they possess. However
it be with other drainage currents and discharges, the drainage
currents and discharges of the brain are not purely
physical facts. They are <i>psycho-physical</i> facts, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
spiritual quality of them seems a codeterminant of their
mechanical effectiveness. If the mechanical activities in a
cell, as they increase, give pleasure, they seem to increase
all the more rapidly for that fact; if they give displeasure,
the displeasure seems to damp the activities. The psychic
side of the phenomenon thus seems, somewhat like the applause
or hissing at a spectacle, to be an encouraging or adverse
<i>comment</i> on what the machinery brings forth. The soul
<i>presents</i> nothing herself; <i>creates</i> nothing; is at the mercy
of the material forces for all <i>possibilities</i>; but amongst
these possibilities she <i>selects</i>; and by reinforcing one and
checking others, she figures not as an 'epiphenomenon,'
but as something from which the play gets moral support.
I shall therefore never hesitate to invoke the efficacy of the
conscious comment, where no strictly mechanical reason
appears why a current escaping from a cell should take
one path rather than another.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> But the <i>existence</i> of the
current, and its <i>tendency</i> towards either path, I feel bound
to account for by mechanical laws.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having now considered a nervous system reduced to its
lowest possible terms, in which all the paths are connate,
and the possibilities of inhibition not extrinsic, but due
solely to the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the feeling
aroused, let us turn to the conditions under which new paths
may be formed. Potentialities of new paths are furnished
by the fibres which connect the sensory cells amongst
themselves; but these fibres are not originally pervious,
and have to be made so by a process which I proceed hypothetically
to state as follows: <i>Each discharge from a sensory
cell in the forward direction</i><a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> <i>tends to drain the cells lying
behind the discharging one of whatever tension they may possess.
The drainage from the rearward cells is what for the first time
makes the fibres pervious. The result is a new-formed 'path,'
running from the cells which were 'rearward' to the cell which
was 'forward' on that occasion; which path, if on future occasions
the rearward cells are independently excited, will tend to
carry off their activity in the same direction so as to excite the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
<i>forward cell, and will deepen itself more and more every time it
is used</i>.</p>

<p>Now the 'rearward cells,' so far, stand for all the sensory
cells of the brain other than the one which is discharging;
but such an indefinitely broad path would practically
be no better than no path, so here I make a third hypothesis,
which, taken together with the others, seems to me
to cover all the facts. It is that <i>the deepest paths are formed
from the most drainable to the most draining cells;</i> that <i>the
most drainable cells are those which have just been discharging,</i>
and that <i>the most draining cells are those which are now discharging
or in which the tension is rising towards the point of
discharge.</i><a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Another diagram, Fig. 88, will make the matter
clear.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/fig_88.jpg" width="200" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 88.</div>
</div>

<p>Take the operation represented
by the previous diagram at the
moment when, the muscular contraction
having occurred, the cell K is
discharging forward into M. Through
the dotted line <i>p</i> it will, according to
our third hypothesis, drain S (which,
in the supposed case, has just discharged
into M by the connate path P, and caused the muscular
contraction), and the result is that <i>p</i> will now remain
as a new path open from S to K. When next S is excited
from without it will tend not only to discharge into M,
but into K as well. K thus gets excited directly by S <i>before</i>
it gets excited by the incoming current from the muscle;
or, translated into psychic terms: <i>when a sensation has
once produced a movement in us, the next time we have the sensation,
it tends to suggest the idea of the movement, even before
the movement occurs.</i><a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span></p>

<p>The same principles also apply to the relations of K
and M. M, lying in the forward direction, drains K, and the
path KM, even though it be no primary or connate path,
becomes a secondary or habitual one. Hereafter K may be
aroused in any way whatsoever (not as before from S or
from without) and still it will tend to discharge into M; or,
to express it again in psychic terms, <i>the idea of the movement
M's sensory effects will have become an immediately antecedent
condition to the production of the movement itself.</i></p>

<p>Here, then, we have the answer to our original question
of how a sensory process which, the first time it occurred,
was the effect of a movement, can later figure as the movement's
cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is obvious on this scheme that the cell which we have
marked K may stand for the seat of either a resident or
a remote sensation occasioned by the motor discharge.
It may indifferently be a tactile, a visual, or an auditory cell.
The idea of how the arm <i>feels</i> when raised may cause it to
rise; but no less may the idea of some <i>sound</i> which it makes
in rising, or of some <i>optical</i> impression which it produces.
Thus we see that the 'mental cue' may belong to either of
various senses; and that what our diagrams lead us to
infer is what really happens; namely, that in our movements,
such as that of speech, for example, in some of us
it is the tactile, in others the acoustic, <i>Effectsbild</i>, or memory-image,
which seems most concerned in starting the articulation
(Vol. I. pp. 54-5). The <i>primitive</i> 'starters,' however, of
all our movements are not <i>Effectsbilder</i> at all, but sensations
and objects, and subsequently ideas derived therefrom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now turn to the more complex and serially concatenated
movements which oftenest meet us in real life.
The object of our will is seldom a single muscular contraction;
it is almost always an orderly sequence of contractions,
ending with a sensation which tells us that the goal is
reached. But the several contractions of the sequence are
not each distinctly willed; each earlier one seems rather,
by the sensation it produces, to call its follower up, after
the fashion described in Chapter VI, where we spoke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
habitual concatenated movements being due to a series of
secondarily organized reflex arcs (Vol. I. p. 116). The first
contraction is the one distinctly willed, and after willing it
we let the rest of the chain rattle off of its own accord.
How now is such an orderly concatenation of movements
originally learned? or in other words, how are paths
formed for the first time between one motor centre and another,
so that the discharge of the first centre makes the
others discharge in due order all along the line?</p>

<p>The phenomenon involves a rapid alternation of motor
discharges and resultant afferent impressions, for as long a
time as it lasts. They must be associated in one definite
order; and the order must once have been <i>learned</i>, i.e., it
must have been picked out and held to more and more
exclusively out of the many other random orders which
first presented themselves. The random afferent impressions
fell out, those that felt right were selected and grew
together in the chain. A chain which we actively teach
ourselves by stringing a lot of right-feeling impressions
together differs in no essential respect from a chain which
we passively learn from someone else who gives us impressions
in a certain order. So to make our ideas more
precise, let us take a particular concatenated movement for
an example, and let it be the recitation of the alphabet,
which someone in our childhood taught us to say by heart.</p>

<p>What we have seen so far is how the idea of the sound
or articulatory feeling of A may make us say 'A,' that of B,
'B,' and so on. But what we now want to see is <i>why the
sensation that A is uttered should make us say 'B,' why the sensation
that B is uttered should make us say 'C,' and so on.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">

<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 89.</div>
</div>

<p>To understand this we must recall what happened when
we first learned the letters in their order. Someone repeated
A, B, C, D to us over and over again, and we imitated
the sounds. Sensory cells corresponding to each
letter were awakened in succession in such wise that each
one of them (by virtue of our second law) must have
'drained' the cell just previously excited and left a path by
which that cell tended ever afterwards to discharge into the
cell that drained it. Let S<sup>a</sup>, S<sup>b</sup>, S<sup>c</sup> in figure 89 stand for
three of these cells. Each later one of them, as it discharges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
motorwards, draws a current from the previous one, S<sup>b</sup> from
S<sup>a</sup>, and S<sup>c</sup> from S<sup>b</sup>. Cell S<sup>b</sup> having thus drained S<sup>a</sup>, if S<sup>a</sup>
ever gets excited again, it tends to discharge into S<sup>b</sup>; whilst
S<sup>c</sup> having drained S<sup>b</sup>, S<sup>b</sup> later discharges into S<sup>c</sup>, etc., etc.&mdash;all
through the dotted lines. Let now the idea of the
letter A arise in the mind, or, in other words, let S<sup>a</sup> be
aroused: what happens? A current runs from S<sup>a</sup> not only
into the motor cell M<sup>a</sup> for pronouncing that letter, but also
into the cell S<sup>b</sup>. When, a moment later, the effect of M<sup>a</sup>'s
discharge comes back by the afferent nerve and re-excites
S<sup>a</sup>, this latter cell is inhibited from discharging again into
M<sup>a</sup> and reproducing the 'primordial motor circle' (which
in this case would be the continued utterance of the letter
A), by the fact that the process in S<sup>b</sup>, already under headway
and tending to discharge into its own motor associate
M<sup>b</sup>, is, <i>under the existing conditions</i>, the stronger drainage-channel
for S<sup>a</sup>'s excitement. The result is that M<sup>b</sup> discharges
and the letter B is pronounced; whilst at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>time S<sup>c</sup> receives some of S<sup>b</sup>'s overflow; and, a moment later
when the sound of B enters the ear, discharges into the
motor cell for pronouncing C, by a repetition of the same
mechanism as before; and so on <i>ad libitum</i>. Figure 90
represents the entire set of processes involved.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig_90.jpg" width="400" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 90.</div>
</div>

<p>The only thing that one does not immediately see is the
reason why 'under the existing conditions' the path from
S<sup>a</sup> to S<sup>b</sup> should be the stronger drainage-channel for S<sup>a</sup>'s
excitement. If the cells and fibres in the figure constituted
the entire brain we might suppose either a mechanical or a
psychical reason. The mechanical reason might lie in a
general law that cells like S<sup>b</sup> and M<sup>b</sup>, whose excitement is in
a rising phase, are stronger drainers than cells like M<sup>a</sup>,
which have just discharged; or it might lie in the fact
that an irradiation of the current beyond S<sup>b</sup> into S<sup>c</sup> and
M<sup>c</sup> has already begun also; and in a still farther law
that drainage tends in the direction of the widest irradiations.
Either of these suppositions would be a sufficient
mechanical reason why, having once said A, we
should not say it again. But we must not forget that
the process has a psychical side, nor close our eyes to the
possibility that the <i>sort of feeling</i> aroused by incipient
currents may be the reason why certain of them are instantly
inhibited and others helped to flow. There is no
doubt that before we have uttered a single letter, the general
intention to recite the alphabet is already there; nor is
there any doubt that to that intention corresponds a widespread
premonitory rising of tensions along the entire
system of cells and fibres which are later to be aroused. So
long as this rise of tensions <i>feels good</i>, so long every current
which increases it is furthered, and every current which
diminishes it is checked; and this may be the chief one of
the 'existing conditions' which make the drainage-channel
from S<sup>a</sup> to S<sup>b</sup> temporarily so strong.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>The new paths between the sensory cells of which we
have studied the formation are paths of 'association,' and
we now see why associations run always in the forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
direction; why, for example, we cannot say the alphabet
backward, and why, although S<sup>b</sup> discharges into S<sup>c</sup>, there
is no tendency for S<sup>c</sup> to discharge into S<sup>b</sup>, or at least no
more than for it to discharge into S<sup>a</sup>.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The first-formed
paths had, according to the principles which we invoked,
to run from cells that had just discharged to those that
were discharging; and now, to get currents to run the other
way, we must go through a new learning of our letters with
their order reversed. There will <i>then</i> be two sets of association-pathways,
either of them possible, between the sensible
cells. I represent them in Fig. 91, leaving out the
motor features for simplicity's sake. The dotted lines are
the paths in the backward direction, newly organized from
the reception by the ear of the letters in the order C B A.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/fig_91.jpg" width="275" alt="engraving" />
<div class="capt02"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 91.</div>
</div>

<p>The same principles will explain the formation of new
paths successively concatenated to no matter how great an
extent, but it would obviously be folly to pretend to illustrate
by more intricate examples. I will therefore only
bring back the case of the child and flame (Vol. I. p. 25), to
show how easily it admits of explanation as a 'purely cortical
transaction' (<i>ibid.</i> p. 80). The sight of the flame stimulates
the cortical centre S<sup>1</sup> which discharges by an instinctive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>reflex path into the centre M<sup>1</sup> for the grasping-movement.
This movement produces the feeling of burn, as its
effects come back to the centre S<sup>2</sup>; and this centre by a
second connate path discharges into M<sup>2</sup>, the centre for
withdrawing the hand. The movement of withdrawal
stimulates the centre S<sup>3</sup>, and this, as far as we are concerned,
is the last thing that happens. Now the next time the child
sees the candle, the cortex is in possession of the secondary
paths which the first experience left behind. S<sup>2</sup>, having been
stimulated immediately after S<sup>1</sup>, drained the latter, and now
S<sup>1</sup> discharges into S<sup>2</sup> before the discharge of M<sup>1</sup> has had time
to occur; in other words, the sight of the flame suggests the
idea of the burn before it produces its own natural reflex effects.
The result is an inhibition of M<sup>1</sup>, or an overtaking
of it before it is completed, by M<sup>2</sup>.&mdash;The characteristic physiological
feature in all these acquired systems of paths lies
in the fact that the new-formed sensory irradiations
keep <i>draining things forward</i>, and so breaking up the 'motor
circles' which would otherwise accrue. But, even apart from
catalepsy, we see the 'motor circle' every now and then
come back. An infant learning to execute a simple movement
at will, without regard to other movements beyond it,
keeps repeating it till tired. How reiteratively they
babble each new-learned word! And we adults often catch
ourselves reiterating some meaningless word over and over
again, if by chance we once begin to utter it 'absent-mindedly,'
that is, without thinking of any ulterior train of words
to which it may belong.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One more observation before closing these already too
protracted physiological speculations. Already (Vol. I. p. 71)
I have tried to shadow forth a reason why collateral innervation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
should establish itself after loss of brain-tissue,
and why incoming stimuli should find their way out again,
after an interval, by their former paths. I can now explain
this a little better. Let S<sup>1</sup> be the dog's hearing-centre when
he receives the command 'Give your paw.' This <i>used</i> to
discharge into the motor centre M<sup>1</sup>, of whose discharge S<sup>2</sup>
represents the kinæsthetic effect; but now M<sup>1</sup> has been destroyed
by an operation, so that S<sup>1</sup> discharges as it can, into
other movements of the body, whimpering, raising the
wrong paw, etc. The kinæsthetic centre S<sup>2</sup> meanwhile has
been awakened by the order S<sup>1</sup>, and the poor animal's mind
tingles with expectation and desire of certain incoming sensations
which are entirely at variance with those which the
really executed movements give. None of the latter sensations
arouse a 'motor circle,' for they are displeasing and
inhibitory. But when, by random accident, S<sup>1</sup> and S<sup>2</sup> <i>do</i>
discharge into a path leading through M<sup>2</sup>, by which the <i>paw is
again given</i>, and S<sup>2</sup> is excited at last from without as well as
from within, there are no inhibitions and the 'motor circle'
is formed: S<sup>1</sup> discharges into M<sup>2</sup> over and over again, and
the path from the one spot to the other is so much deepened
that at last it becomes organized as the regular channel of
efflux when S<sup>1</sup> is aroused. No other path has a chance of
being organized in like degree.</p>

cases without the kinæsthetic impression. Thus Dr. Strümpell relates
how turning over the boy's hand made him bend the little finger instead of
the forefinger, when his eye was closed. "Ordered to point, e.g., towards
the left with his left arm, the arm was usually raised straight forward, and
then wandered about in groping uncertainty, sometimes getting the right
position and then leaving it again. Similarly with the lower limbs. If the
patient, lying in bed, had, immediately after the tying of his eyes, to lay
the left leg over the right, it often happened that he moved it farther over
towards the left, and that it lay over the side of the bed in apparently
the most intolerably-uncomfortable position. The turning of the head,
too, from right to left, or towards certain objects known to the patient, only
ensued correctly when the patient, immediately before his eye was bandaged,
specially refreshed his perception as to what the required movement was
to be." In another anæsthetic of Dr. Strümpell's (described in the same
essay) the arm could not be moved <i>at all</i> unless the eyes were opened,
however energetic the volition. The variations in these hysteric cases are
great. Some patients cannot move the anæsthetic part <i>at all</i> when the eyes
are closed. Others move it perfectly well, and can even write continuous
sentences with the anæsthetic hand. The causes of such differences are as
yet incompletely unexplored. M. Binet suggests (Revue Philosophique,
xxv. 478) that in those who cannot move the hand at all the sensation of
light is required as a 'dynamogenic' agent (see above, <a href="#Page_377">p. 377</a>); and that in
those who can move it skilfully the anæsthesia is only a pseudo-insensibility
and that the limb is in reality governed by a dissociated or secondary
consciousness. This latter explanation is certainly correct. Professor
G. E. Müller (Pflüger's Archiv, xlv. 90) invokes the fact of individual
differences of imagination to account for the cases who cannot write at all.
Their kinæsthetic images properly so called may be weak, he says, and
their optical images insufficiently powerful to supplement them without a
'fillip' from sensation. Janet's observation that hysteric anæsthesias may
carry amnesias with them would perfectly legitimate Müller's supposition.
What we now want is a minute examination of the individual cases.
Meanwhile Binet's article above referred to, and Bastian's paper in Brain
for April 1887, contain important discussions of the question. In a later
note I shall return to the subject again (see <a href="#Page_520">p. 520</a>).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_438_438" id="Footnote_438_438"></a><a href="#FNanchor_438_438"><span class="label">[438]</span></a> As the feeling of heat, for example, is the last psychic antecedent of
sweating, as the feeling of bright light is that of the pupil's contraction, as
the sight or smell of carrion is that of the movements of disgust, as the
remembrance of a blunder may be that of a blush, so the idea of a movement's
sensible effects might be that of the movement itself. It is true
that the idea of sweating will not commonly make us sweat, nor that of
blushing make us blush. But in certain nauseated states the idea of vomiting
will make us vomit; and a kind of sequence which is in this case
realized only exceptionally might be the rule with the so-called voluntary
muscles. It all depends on the nervous connections between the centres
of ideation and the discharging paths. These may differ from one sort of
centre to another. They do differ somewhat from one individual to another.
Many persons never blush at the idea of their blunders, but only
when the actual blunder is committed; others blush at the idea; and some
do not blush at all. According to Lotze, with some persons "It is possible
to weep at will by trying to recall that peculiar feeling in the trigeminal
nerve which habitually precedes tears. Some can even succeed in sweating
voluntarily, by the lively recollection of the characteristic skin-sensations,
and the voluntary reproduction of an indescribable sort of feeling of relaxation,
which ordinarily precedes the flow of perspiration." (Med. Psych.,
p. 303.) The commoner type of exceptional case is that in which the idea
of the <i>stimulus</i>, not that of the effects, provokes the effects. Thus we
read of persons who contract their pupils at will by strongly imagining a
brilliant light. A gentleman once informed me (strangely enough I cannot
recall who he was, but I have an impression of his being a medical man)
that he could sweat at will by imagining himself on the brink of a precipice.
The sweating palms of fear are sometimes producible by imagining a terrible
object (cf. Manouvrier in Rev. Phil., xxii. 203). One of my students,
whose eyes were made to water by sitting in the dentist's chair before a
bright window, can now shed tears by imagining that situation again.
One might doubtless collect a large number of idiosyncratic cases of this
sort. They teach us how greatly the centres vary in their power to discharge
through certain channels. All that we need, now, to account for
the differences observed between the psychic antecedents of the voluntary
and involuntary movements is that centres producing ideas of the
movement's sensible effects should be able to instigate the former, but be
out of gear with the latter, unless in exceptional individuals. The famous
case of Col. Townsend, who could stop his heart at will, is well known.
See, on this whole matter, D. H. Tuke: Illustrations of the Influence of
the Mind on the Body, chap. xiv. § 3; also J. Braid: Observations on
Trance or Human Hybernation (1850). The latest reported case of voluntary
control of the heart is by Dr. S. A. Pease, in Boston Medical and Surgical
Journal, May 30, 1889.</p></div>

Müller thus describes some of his experiments with weights: If, after
lifting a weight of 8000 grams a number of times we suddenly get a weight
of only 500 grams to lift, "this latter weight is then lifted with a velocity
which strikes every onlooker, so that the receptacle for the weight with all
its contents often flies high up as if it carried the arm along with it, and
the energy with which it is raised is sometimes so entirely out of proportion
to the weight itself, that the contents of the receptacle are slung out
upon the table in spite of the mechanical obstacles which such a result has
to overcome. A more palpable proof that the trouble here is a wrong adaptation
of the motor impulse could not be given." Pflüger's Archiv, xlv.

"Ask a man whose lower extremities are completely paralyzed, whether,
when he ineffectually wills to move either of these limbs, he is conscious
of an expenditure of energy in any degree proportionate to that which he
would have experienced if his muscles had naturally responded to his volition.
He will tell us rather that he has a sense only of his utter powerlessness,
and that his volition is a mere mental act, carrying with it no feelings
of expended energy such as he is accustomed to experience when his
muscles are in powerful action, and from which action and its consequences
alone, as I think, he can derive any adequate notion of resistance."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_448_448" id="Footnote_448_448"></a><a href="#FNanchor_448_448"><span class="label">[448]</span></a> Münsterberg's words may be added: "In lifting an object in the
hand I can discover no sensation of volitional energy. I perceive in the
first place a slight tension about the head, but that this results from a contraction
in the head muscles, and not from a feeling of the brain-discharge,
is shown by the simple fact that I get the tension on the right side of the
head when I move the right arm, whereas the motor discharge takes place
in the opposite side of the brain.... In maximal contractions of body- and
limb-muscles there occur, as if it were to reinforce them, those special
contractions of the muscles of the face [especially frowning and clinching
teeth] and those tensions of the skin of the head. These sympathetic
movements, felt particularly on the side which makes the effort, are perhaps
the immediate ground why we ascribe our awareness of maximal contraction
to the region of the head, and call it a consciousness of force, instead
of a peripheral sensation." (Die Willenshandlung (1888), pp. 73, 82.) Herr
Münsterberg's work is a little masterpiece, which appeared after my text
was written. I shall have repeatedly to refer to it again, and cordially
recommend to the reader its most thorough refutation of the Innervationsgefühl-theory.</p></div>

<p>
Professor Mach in his wonderfully original little work 'Beiträge zur
Analyse der Empfindungen,' p. 57, describes an artificial way of getting
translocation, and explains the effect likewise by the feeling of innervation.
"Turn your eyes," he says, "as far as possible towards the left and press
against the right sides of the orbits two large lumps of putty. If you then
try to look as quickly as possible towards the right, this succeeds, on account
of the incompletely spherical form of the eyes, only imperfectly, and
the objects consequently appear translocated very considerably towards the
right. The <i>bare will</i> to look rightwards gives to all images on the retina a
greater <i>rightwards value</i>, to express it shortly. The experiment is at first
surprising."&mdash;I regret to say that I cannot myself make it succeed&mdash;I know
not for what reason. But even where it does succeed it seems to me that
the conditions are much too complicated for Professor Mach's theoretic conclusions
to be safely drawn. The putty squeezed into the orbit, and the
pressure of the eyeball against it must give rise to peripheral sensations
<i>strong</i> enough, at any rate (if only of the right kind), to justify any amount
of false perception of our eyeball's position, quite apart from the innervation
feelings which Professor Mach supposes to coexist.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_453_453" id="Footnote_453_453"></a><a href="#FNanchor_453_453"><span class="label">[453]</span></a> An illusion in principle exactly analogous to that of the patient under
discussion can be produced experimentally in anyone in a way which
Hering has described in his Lehre von Binocularen Sehen, pp. 13-14. I will
quote Helmholtz's account of it, which is especially valuable as coming
from a believer in the <i>Innervationsgefühl</i>: "Let the two eyes first look
parallel, then let the right eye be closed whilst the left still looks at the infinitely
distant object <i>a</i>. The directions of both eyes will thus remain unaltered,
and <i>a</i> will be seen in its right place. Now accommodate the left
eye for a point <i>f</i> [a needle in Hering's experiment] lying on the optical
axis between it and <i>a</i>, only very near. The position of the left eye and its
optical axis, as well as the place of the retinal image upon it... are
wholly unaltered by this movement. But the consequence is that an apparent
movement of the object occurs&mdash;a movement towards the left. As
soon as we accommodate again for distance the object returns to its old
place. Now what alters itself in this experiment is only the position of the
closed right eye: its optical axis, when the effort is made to accommodate
for the point <i>f</i>, also converges towards this point.... Conversely it is
possible for me to make my optical axes diverge, even with closed eyes, so
that in the above experiment the right eye should turn far to the right of
<i>a</i>. This divergence is but slowly reached, and gives me therefore no
illusory movement. But when I suddenly relax my effort to make it, and
the right optical axis springs back to the parallel position, I immediately
see the object which the left eye fixates shift its position towards the left.
Thus not only the position of the seeing eye <i>a</i>, but also that of the closed
eye <i>b</i>, influences our judgment of the direction in which the seen object
lies. The open eye remaining fixed, and the closed eye moving towards
the right or left, the object seen by the open eye appears also to move towards
the right or left" (Physiol. Optik, pp. 607-8.)</p></div>

Herr Münsterberg gives additional reasons against the feeling of innervation,
of which I will quote a couple. First, our ideas of movement are
all <i>faint</i> ideas, resembling in this the copies of sensations in memory. Were
they feelings of the outgoing discharge, they would be original states of
consciousness, not copies; and ought by analogy to be <i>vivid</i> like other
original states.&mdash;Second, our unstriped muscles yield no feelings in contracting,
nor can they be contracted at will, differing thus in <i>two</i> peculiarities
from the voluntary muscles. What more natural than to suppose that
the two peculiarities hang together, and that the reason why we cannot contract
our intestines, for example, at will, is, that we have no memory-images
of how their contraction feels? Were the supposed innervation-feeling always
the 'mental cue,' one doesn't see why we might not have it even
where, as here, the contractions themselves are unfelt, and why it might
not bring the contractions about. (Die Willenshandlung, pp 87-8.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_459_459" id="Footnote_459_459"></a><a href="#FNanchor_459_459"><span class="label">[459]</span></a> Herr Sternberg (Pflüger's Archiv, xxxvii. p. 1) thinks that he proves
the feeling of innervation by the fact that when we have willed to make a
movement we generally think that it is made. We have already seen some
of the facts on <a href="#Page_105">pp. 105-6</a>, above. S. cites from Exner the fact that if we
put a piece of hard rubber between our back teeth and bite, our front teeth
seem actually to approach each other, although it is physically impossible
for them to do so. He proposes the following experiment: Lay the palm
of the hand on a table with the forefinger overlapping its edge and flexed
back as far as possible, whilst the table keeps the other fingers extended;
then try to flex the terminal joint of the forefinger without looking. You
do not do it, and yet you think that you do. Here again the innervation,
according to the author, is felt as an executed movement. It seems to me,
as I said in the previous place, that the illusion is in all these cases due to
the inveterate association of ideas. Normally our will to move has always
been followed by the sensation that we <i>have</i> moved, except when the
simultaneous sensation of an external resistance was there. The result is
that where we feel no external resistance, and the muscles and tendons
tighten, the invariably associated idea is intense enough to be hallucinatory.
In the experiment with the teeth, the resistance customarily met with when
our masseters contract is a soft one. We do not close our teeth on a thing
like hard rubber once in a million times; so when we do so, we imagine
the habitual result.&mdash;Persons with <i>amputated limbs</i> more often than not
continue to feel them as if they were still there, and can, moreover, give
themselves the feeling of moving them at will. The life-long sensorial
associate of the idea of 'working one's toes,' e.g. (uncorrected by any
opposite sensation, since no real sensation of non-movement can come
from non-existing toes), follows the idea and swallows it up. The man
thinks that his toes are 'working' (cf. Proceedings of American Soc. for
Psych. Research, p. 249).
</p>
<p>
Herr Loeb also comes to the rescue of the feeling of innervation with
observations of his own made after my text was written, but they convince
me no more than the arguments of others. Loeb's facts are these (Pflüger's
Archiv, xliv. p. 1): If we stand before a vertical surface, and if, with our
hands <i>at different heights</i>, we <i>simultaneously</i> make with them what seem to us
equally extensive movements, that movement always turns out really shorter
which is made with the arm whose muscles (in virtue of the arm's position)
are already the more contracted. The same result ensues when the arms are
laterally unsymmetrical. Loeb assumes that both arms contract by virtue
of a common innervation, but that although this innervation is relatively
less effective upon the more contracted arm, our <i>feeling</i> of its equal
strength overpowers the disparity of the incoming sensations of movement
which the two limbs send back, and makes us think that the spaces they
traverse are the same. "The sensation of the extent and direction of our
voluntary movements depends accordingly upon the impulse of our will to
move, and not upon the feelings set up by the motion in the active organ."
Now if this is the elementary law which Loeb calls it, why does it only
manifest its effect when both hands are moving simultaneously? Why
not when the <i>same</i> hand makes <i>successive</i> movements? and especially why
not when both hands move symmetrically or at the same level, but <i>one of
them</i> is <i>weighted</i>? A weighted hand surely requires a stronger innervation
than an unweighted one to move an equal distance upwards; and yet, as
Loeb confesses, we do not tend to overestimate the path which it traverses
under these circumstances. The fact is that the illusion which Loeb
has studied is a complex resultant of many factors. One of them, it seems
to me, is an instinctive tendency to <i>revert to the type of the bilateral
movements of childhood</i>. In adult life we move our arms for the most
part in alternation; but in infancy the free movements of the arms are
almost always similar on both sides, symmetrical when the direction of
motion is horizontal, and with the hands on the same level when it is vertical.
The most natural innervation, when the movements are rapidly performed,
is one which takes the movement hack to this form. Our <i>estimation</i>
meanwhile of the lengths severally traversed by the two hands is
mainly based, as such estimations with closed eyes usually are (see Loeb's
own earlier paper, <i>Untersuchungen über den Fühlraum der Hand</i>, in
Pflüger's Archiv, xli. 107), upon the apparent velocity and duration of
the movement. The duration is the same for both hands, since the movements
begin and end simultaneously. The velocities of the two hands are
under the experimental conditions almost impossible of comparison. It is
well known how imperfect a discrimination of <i>weights</i> we have when we
'heft' them simultaneously, one in either hand; and G. E. Müller has well
shown (Pflüger's Archiv, xlv. 57) that the velocity of the lift is the main
factor in determining our judgment of weight. It is hardly possible to
conceive of more unfavorable conditions for making an accurate comparison
of the length of two movements than those which govern the experiments
which are under discussion. The only prominent sign is the duration,
which would lead us to infer the equality of the two movements. We
consequently deem them equal, though a native tendency in our motor
centres keeps them from being so.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_463_463" id="Footnote_463_463"></a><a href="#FNanchor_463_463"><span class="label">[463]</span></a> The same caution must be shown in discussing pathological cases.
There are remarkable discrepancies in the effects of peripheral anæsthesia
upon the voluntary power. Such cases as I quoted in the text (<a href="#Page_490">p. 490</a>) are
by no means the only type. In those cases the patients could move their
limbs accurately when the eyes were open, and inaccurately when they
were shut. In other cases, however, the anæsthetic patients <i>cannot move
their limbs at all</i> when the eyes are shut. (For reports of two such cases see
Bastian in 'Brain,' Binet in Rev. Philos., xxv. 478.) M. Binet explains
these (hysterical) cases as requiring the 'dynamogenic' stimulus of light (see
above, <a href="#Page_377">p. 377</a>). They <i>might</i>, however, be cases of such congenitally defective
optical imagination that the 'mental cue' was normally 'tactile;' and that
when this tactile cue failed through functional inertness of the kinæsthetic
centres, the only optical cue strong enough to determine the discharge had
to be an actual <i>sensation</i> of the eye.&mdash;There is still a third class of cases in
which the limbs have lost all sensibility, even for movements passively imprinted,
but in which voluntary movements can be accurately executed
even when the eyes are closed. MM. Binet and Féré have reported some
of these interesting cases, which are found amongst the hysterical hemianæsthetics.
They can, for example, write accurately at will, although their
eyes are closed and they have no feeling of the writing taking place, and
many of them do not know when it begins or stops. Asked to write repeatedly
the letter <i>a</i>, and then say how many times they have written it,
some are able to assign the number and some are not. Some of them admit
that they are guided by visual imagination of what is being done. Cf.
Archives de Physiologie, Oct. 1887, pp. 363-5. Now it would seem at
first sight that feelings of outgoing innervation must exist in these cases
and be kept account of. There are no other guiding impressions, either
immediate or remote, of which the patient is conscious; and unless feelings
of innervation be there, the writing would seem miraculous. But if such
feelings are present in these cases, and suffice to direct accurately the succession
of movements, why do they not suffice in those other anæsthetic
cases in which movement becomes disorderly when the eyes are closed?
<i>Innervation</i> is there, or there would be no movement; why is the <i>feeling</i>
of the innervation gone? The truth seems to be, as M. Binet supposes
(Rev. Philos., xxiii. p. 479), that these cases are not arguments for the feeling
of innervation. They are pathological curiosities; and the patients are
not really anæsthetic, but are victims of that curious dissociation or splitting-off
of one part of their consciousness from the rest which we are just beginning
to understand, thanks to Messrs. Janet, Binet, and Gurney, and in which
the split-off part (in this case the kinæsthetic sensations) may nevertheless
remain to produce its usual effects. Compare what was said above, <a href="#Page_491">p. 491</a>.</p></div>

on the Will this author has most explicitly maintained the position that
what we call muscular exertion is an afferent and not an efferent feeling;
"We must affirm universally that in the muscular feeling we are not sensible
of <i>the force</i> on its way to produce an effect, but only of the <i>sufferance</i>
already produced in our movable organs, the muscles, after the force has,
in a manner unobservable by us, exerted upon them its causality" (p. 311).

is required for its impulsiveness to be effective in a complete degree.
There is an inertia in the motor processes as in all other natural things.
In certain individuals, and at certain times (disease, fatigue), the inertia is
unusually great, and we may then have ideas of action which produce no
visible act, but discharge themselves into merely nascent dispositions to
activity or into emotional expression. The inertia of the motor parts here
plays the same rôle as is elsewhere played by antagonistic ideas. We shall
consider this restrictive inertia later on, it obviously introduces no essential
alteration into the law which the text lays down.</p></div>

Harvard Monthly, vol. vi. p. 43, Mr. A. T. Dudley assigns the first place
to the rapidly impulsive temperament. "Ask him how, in some complex
trick, he performed a certain act, why he pushed or pulled at a certain instant,
and he will tell you he does not know; he did it by instinct; or
rather his nerves and muscles did it of themselves.... Here is the distinguishing
feature of the good player: the good player, confident in his
training and his practice, in the critical game trusts entirely to his impulse,
and does not think out every move. The poor player, unable to trust his
impulsive actions, is compelled to think carefully all the time. He thus
not only loses the opportunities through his slowness in comprehending the
whole situation, but, being compelled to think rapidly all the time, at critical
points becomes confused; while the first-rate player, not trying to
reason, but acting as impulse directs, is continually distinguishing himself
and plays the better under the greater pressure."</p></div>

Take, for example, Prof. Bain's explanation of sociability and parental
love by the pleasures of touch: "Touch is the fundamental and generic
sense.... Even after the remaining senses are differentiated, the primary
sense continues to be a leading susceptibility of the mind. The soft warm
touch, if not a first-class influence, is at least an approach to that. The
combined power of soft contact and warmth amounts to a considerable
pitch of massive pleasure; while there may be subtle influences not reducible
to these two heads, such as we term, from not knowing anything
about them, magnetic or electric. The sort of thrill from taking a baby in
arms is something beyond mere warm touch; and it may rise to the ecstatic
height, in which case, however, there may be concurrent sensations and
ideas.... In mere tender emotion not sexual, there is nothing but the
sense of touch to gratify, unless we assume the occult magnetic influences....
In a word, our love pleasures begin and end in sensual contact. Touch
is both the alpha and omega of affection. As the terminal and satisfying
sensation, the <i>ne plus ultra</i>, it must be a pleasure of the highest degree....
Why should a more lively feeling grow up towards a fellow-being than
towards a perennial fountain? [This 'should' is simply delicious from
the more modern evolutionary point of view.] It must be that there is a
source of pleasure in the companionship of other sentient creatures, over
and above the help afforded by them in obtaining the necessaries of life.
To account for this, I can suggest nothing but the primary and independent
pleasure of the animal embrace." [Mind, this is said not of the sexual
interest, but of 'Sociability at Large.'] "For this pleasure every creature
is disposed to pay something, even when it is only fraternal. A certain
amount of material benefit imparted is a condition of the full heartiness of a
responding embrace, the complete fruition of this primitive joy. In the
absence of those conditions the pleasure of giving ... can scarcely be
accounted for; we know full well that, without these helps, it would be a
very meagre sentiment in beings like ourselves.... It seems to me that
there must be at the [parental instinct's] foundation that intense pleasure in
the embrace of the young which we find to characterize the parental feeling
throughout. Such a pleasure once created would associate itself with the
prevailing features and aspects of the young, and give to all of these their
very great interest. For the sake of the pleasure, the parent discovers the
necessity of nourishing the subject of it, and comes to regard the ministering
function as a part or condition of the delight" (Emotions and Will,
pp. 126, 127, 132, 133, 140). Prof. Bain does not explain why a satin
cushion kept at about 98º F. would not on the whole give us the pleasure in
question more cheaply than our friends and babies do. It is true that the
cushion might lack the 'occult magnetic influences.' Most of us would
say that neither a baby's nor a friend's skin would possess them, were not
a tenderness already there. The youth who feels ecstasy shoot through
him when by accident the silken palm or even the 'vesture's hem' of his
idol touches him, would hardly feel it were he not hard hit by Cupid in
advance. The love creates the ecstasy, not the ecstasy the love. And for
the rest of us can it possibly be that all our social virtue springs from an
appetite for the sensual pleasure of having our hand shaken, or being
slapped on the back?</p></div>

many persons say that where they disbelieve in the effects ensuing, as in
the case of the table, they cannot will it. They "cannot exert a volition
that a table should move." This personal difference may be partly verbal.
Different people may attach different connotations to the word 'will.'
But I incline to think that we differ psychologically as well. When one
knows that he has no power, one's desire of a thing is called a <i>wish</i> and
not a will. The sense of impotence inhibits the volition. Only by abstracting
from the thought of the impossibility am I able to imagine strongly
the table sliding over the floor, to make the bodily 'effort' which I do, and
to will it to come towards me. It may be that some people are unable
to perform this abstraction, and that the image of the table stationary
on the floor inhibits the contradictory image of its moving, which is the
object to be willed.</p></div>

willed.</p></div>

from the <i>muscular</i> effort with which it is usually confounded. The latter
consists of all those peripheral feelings to which a muscular 'exertion'
may give rise. These feelings, whenever they are massive and the body is
not 'fresh,' are rather disagreeable, especially when accompanied by stopped
breath, congested head, bruised skin of fingers, toes, or shoulders, and
strained joints. And it is only <i>as thus disagreeable</i> that the mind must
make its <i>volitional</i> effort in stably representing their reality and consequently
bringing it about. That they happen to be made real by muscular
activity is a purely accidental circumstance. A soldier standing still to be
fired at expects disagreeable sensations from his muscular passivity. The
action of his will, in sustaining the expectation, is identical with that
required for a painful muscular effort. What is hard for both <i>is facing an
idea as real</i>.
</p>
<p>
Where much muscular effort is not needed or where the 'freshness' is
very great, the volitional effort is not required to sustain the idea of movement,
which comes then and stays in virtue of association's simpler laws.
More commonly, however, muscular effort involves volitional effort as
well. Exhausted with fatigue and wet and watching, the sailor on a
wreck throws himself down to rest. But hardly are his limbs fairly
relaxed, when the order 'To the pumps!' again sounds in his ears. Shall
he, can he, obey it? Is it not better just to let his aching body lie, and let
the ship go down if she will? So he lies on, till, with a desperate heave
of the will, at last he staggers to his legs, and to his task again. Again,
there are instances where the fiat demands great volitional effort though
the muscular exertion be insignificant, e.g., the getting out of bed and
bathing one's self on a cold morning.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_502_502" id="Footnote_502_502"></a><a href="#FNanchor_502_502"><span class="label">[502]</span></a> <i>Caricatures</i> of the kind of supposition which free will demands abound
in deterministic literature. The following passage from John Fiske's Cosmic
Philosophy (pt. ii. chap. xvii) is an example: "If volitions arise
without cause, it necessarily follows that we cannot infer from them the
character of the antecedent states of feeling. If, therefore, a murder has
been committed, we have <i>a priori</i> no better reason for suspecting the worst
enemy than the best friend of the murdered man. If we see a man jump
from a fourth-story window, we must beware of too hastily inferring his
insanity, since he may be merely exercising his free-will; the intense love
of life implanted in the human breast being, as it seems, unconnected
with attempts at suicide or at self-preservation. We can thus frame no
theory of human actions whatever. The countless empirical maxims of
every-day life, the embodiment as they are of the inherited and organized
sagacity of many generations, become wholly incompetent to guide us;
and nothing which any one may do ought ever to occasion surprise. The
mother may strangle her first-born child, the miser may cast his long-treasured
gold into the sea, the sculptor may break in pieces his lately-finished
statue, in the presence of no other feelings than those which
before led them to cherish, to hoard, and to create.
</p>
<p>
"To state these conclusions is to refute their premise. Probably no
defender of the doctrine of free-will could be induced to accept them, even
to save the theorem with which they are inseparably wrapped up. Yet the
dilemma cannot be avoided. Volitions are either caused or they are not. If
they are not caused, an inexorable logic brings us to the absurdities just
mentioned. If they are caused, the free-will doctrine is annihilated....
In truth, the immediate corollaries of the free-will doctrine are so shocking,
not only to philosophy but to common-sense, that were not accurate
thinking a somewhat rare phenomenon, it would be inexplicable how any
credit should ever have been given to such a dogma. This is but one of
the many instances in which by the force of words alone men have been
held subject to chronic delusion.... Attempting, as the free-will philosophers
do, to destroy the science of history, they are compelled by an
inexorable logic to pull down with it the cardinal principles of ethics,
politics, and jurisprudence. Political economy, if rigidly dealt with on
their theory, would fare little better; and psychology would become
chaotic jargon.... The denial of causation is the affirmation of chance,
and 'between the theory of Chance and the theory of Law there can be
no compromise, no reciprocity, no borrowing and lending.' To write
history on any method furnished by the free-will doctrine would be utterly
impossible."&mdash;All this comes from Mr. Fiske's not distinguishing between
the possibles which really tempts man and those which tempt him not at
all. Free-will, like psychology, deals with the former possibles exclusively.</p></div>

<h4>HYPNOTISM.</h4>

<h4>MODES OF OPERATING, AND SUSCEPTIBILITY.</h4>


<p>The 'hypnotic,' 'mesmeric,' or 'magnetic' trance <i>can
be induced in various ways,</i> each operator having his pet
method. The simplest one is to leave the subject seated
by himself, telling him that if he close his eyes and relax
his muscles and, as far as possible, think of vacancy, in a
few minutes he will 'go off.' On returning in ten minutes
you may find him effectually hypnotized. Braid used to
make his subjects look at a bright button held near their
forehead until their eyes spontaneously closed. The older
mesmerists made 'passes' in a downward direction over
the face and body, but without contact. Stroking the skin
of the head, face, arms and hands, especially that of the
region round the brows and eyes, will have the same effect.
Staring into the eyes of the subject until the latter droop,
making him listen to a watch's ticking; or simply making
him close his eyes for a minute whilst you describe to him
the feeling of falling into sleep, 'talk sleep' to him, are
equally efficacious methods in the hands of some operators;
whilst with trained subjects any method whatever from
which they have been led by previous suggestion to expect
results will be successful.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> The touching of an object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
which they are told has been 'magnetized,' the drinking of
'magnetized' water, the reception of a letter ordering them
to sleep, etc., are means which have been frequently employed.
Recently M. Liégeois has hypnotized some of his
subjects at a distance of 1 1/2 kilometres by giving them an
intimation to that effect through a telephone. With some
subjects, if you tell them in advance that at a certain hour
of a certain day they will become entranced, the prophecy
is fulfilled. Certain hysterical patients are immediately
thrown into hypnotic catalepsy by any violent sensation,
such as a blow on a gong or the flashing of an intense
light in their eyes. Pressure on certain parts of the body
(called <i>zones hypnogènes</i> by M. Pitres) rapidly produces
hypnotic sleep in some hysterics. These regions, which
differ in different subjects, are oftenest found on the forehead
and about the root of the thumbs. Finally, persons
in ordinary sleep may be transferred into the hypnotic condition
by verbal intimation or contact, performed so gently
as not to wake them up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some operators appear to be more successful than others
in getting control of their subjects. I am informed that Mr.
Gurney (who made valuable contributions to the theory of
hypnotism) was never able himself to hypnotize, and had to
use for his observations the subjects of others. On the other
hand, Dr. Liébeault claims that he hypnotizes 92% of all
comers, and Wetterstrand in Stockholm says that amongst
718 persons there proved to be only 18 whom he failed to
influence. Some of this disparity is unquestionably due to
differences in the personal 'authority' of the operator, for
the prime condition of success is that the subject should
confidently <i>expect</i> to be entranced. Much also depends on
the operator's tact in interpreting the physiognomy of his
subjects, so as to give the right commands, and 'crowd it
on' to the subject, at just the propitious moments. These
conditions account for the fact that operators grow more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
successful the more they operate. Bernheim says that
whoever does not hypnotize 80 per cent of the persons
whom he tries has not yet learned to operate as he should.
Whether certain operators have over and above this a
peculiar 'magnetic power' is a question which I leave
at present undecided.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Children under three or four, and
insane persons, especially idiots, are unusually hard to
hypnotize. This seems due to the impossibility of getting
them to fix their attention continuously on the idea of the
coming trance. All ages above infancy are probably
equally hypnotizable, as are all races and both sexes. A
certain amount of mental training, sufficient to aid concentration
of the attention, seems a favorable condition, and so
does a certain momentary indifference or passivity as to the
result. Native strength or weakness of 'will' have absolutely
nothing to do with the matter. Frequent trances
enormously increase the susceptibility of a subject, and
many who resist at first succumb after several trials. Dr.
Moll says he has more than once succeeded after forty
fruitless attempts. Some experts are of the opinion that
every one is hypnotizable essentially, the only difficulty
being the more habitual presence in some individuals of
hindering mental preoccupations, which, however, may suddenly
at some moment be removed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The trance may be dispelled instantaneously by saying
in a rousing voice, 'All right, wake up!' or words of similar
purport. At the Salpétrière they awaken subjects by blowing
on their eyelids. Upward passes have an awakening
effect; sprinkling cold water ditto. Anything will awaken
a patient who expects to be awakened by that thing. Tell
him that he will wake after counting five, and he will do
so. Tell him to waken in five minutes, and he is very likely
to do so punctually, even though he interrupt thereby some
exciting histrionic performance which you may have suggested.&mdash;As
Dr. Moll says, any theory which pretends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
explain the physiology of the hypnotic state must keep
account of the fact that so simple a thing as hearing the
word 'wake!' will end it.</p>


<h4>THEORIES ABOUT THE HYPNOTIC STATE.</h4>


<p><i>The intimate nature of the hypnotic condition,</i> when once
induced, can hardly be said to be understood. Without
entering into details of controversy, one may say that three
main opinions have been held concerning it, which we may
call respectively the theories of</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">1. Animal magnetism;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2. of Neurosis; and finally of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">3. Suggestion.</span><br />
</p>

<p>According to the <i>animal-magnetism theory</i> there is a
direct passage of force from the operator to the subject,
whereby the latter becomes the former's puppet. This
theory is nowadays given up as regards all the ordinary
hypnotic phenomena, and is only held to by some persons
as an explanation of a few effects exceptionally met with.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>According to the <i>neurosis-theory</i>, the hypnotic state is
a peculiar pathological condition into which certain predisposed
patients fall, and in which special physical agents
have the power of provoking special symptoms, quite apart
from the subjects mentally expecting the effect. Professor
Charcot and his colleagues at the Salpétrière hospital admit
that this condition is rarely found in typical form. They call
it then <i>le grand hypnotisme</i>, and say that it accompanies the
disease hystero-epilepsy. If a patient subject to this sort
of hypnotism hear a sudden loud noise, or look at a bright
light unexpectedly, she falls into the <i>cataleptic</i> trance. Her
limbs and body offer no resistance to movements communicated
to them, but retain permanently the attitudes impressed.
The eyes are staring, there is insensibility to
pain, etc., etc. If the eyelids be forcibly closed, the cataleptic
gives place to the <i>lethargic</i> condition, characterized
by apparent abolition of consciousness, and absolute muscular
relaxation except where the muscles are kneaded or
the tendons struck by the operator's hand, or certain nerve-trunks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
are pressed upon. Then the muscles in question,
or those supplied by the same nerve-trunk enter into a more
or less steadfast tonic contraction. Charcot calls this symptom
by the name of neuro-muscular hyperexcitability. The
lethargic state may be <i>primarily</i> brought on by fixedly
looking at anything, or by pressure on the closed eyeballs.
Friction on the top of the head will make the patient pass
from either of the two preceding conditions into the <i>somnambulic</i>
state, in which she is alert, talkative, and susceptible
to all the suggestions of the operator. The somnambulic
state may also be induced primarily, by fixedly looking
at a small object. In this state the accurately limited
muscular contractions characteristic of lethargy do not
follow upon the above-described manipulations, but instead
of them there is a tendency to rigidity of entire regions of
the body, which may upon occasion develop into general
tetanus, and which is brought about by gently touching the
skin or blowing upon it. M. Charcot calls this by the
name of cutaneo-muscular hyperexcitability.</p>

<p>Many other symptoms, supposed by their observers to
be independent of mental expectation, are described, of
which I only will mention the more interesting. Opening the
eyes of a patient in lethargy causes her to pass into catalepsy.
If one eye only be opened, the corresponding half of the body
becomes cataleptic, whilst the other half remains in lethargy.
Similarly, rubbing one side of the head may result
in a patient becoming hemilethargic or hemicataleptic and
hemisomnambulic. The approach of a magnet (or certain
metals) to the skin causes these half-states (and many others)
to be transferred to the opposite sides. Automatic repetition
of every sound heard ('<i>echolalia</i>') is said to be produced by
pressure on the lower cervical vertebræ or on the epigastrium.
<i>Aphasia</i> is brought about by rubbing the head over
the region of the speech-centre. Pressure behind the occiput
determines <i>movements of imitation</i>. Heidenhain describes a
number of curious automatic tendencies to movement, which
are brought about by stroking various portions of the vertebral
column. Certain other symptoms have been frequently
noticed, such as a flushed face and cold hands,
brilliant and congested eyes, dilated pupils. Dilated retinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
vessels and spasm of the accommodation are also reported.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The theory of Suggestion</i> denies that there is any special
hypnotic <i>state</i> worthy of the name of trance or neurosis.
All the symptoms above described, as well as those to be
described hereafter, are results of that mental susceptibility
which we all to some degree possess, of yielding
assent to outward suggestion, of affirming what we strongly
conceive, and of acting in accordance with what we are
made to expect. The bodily symptoms of the Salpétrière
patients are all of them results of expectation and training.
The first patients accidentally did certain things which
their doctors thought typical and caused to be repeated.
The subsequent subjects 'caught on' and followed the
established tradition. In proof of this the fact is urged
that the classical three stages and their grouped symptoms
have <i>only</i> been reported as spontaneously occurring, so far,
at the Salpétrière, though they may be superinduced by
deliberate suggestion, in patients anywhere found. The
ocular symptoms, the flushed face, accelerated breathing,
etc., are said not to be symptoms of the passage into the
hypnotic state as such, but merely consequences of the
strain on the eyes when the method of looking at a bright
object is used. They are absent in the subjects at Nancy,
where simple verbal suggestion is employed. The various
reflex effects (aphasia, echolalia, imitation, etc.) are but
habits induced by the influence of the operator, who unconsciously
urges the subject into the direction in which he
would prefer to have him go. The influence of the magnet,
the opposite effects of upward and downward passes, etc.,
are similarly explained. Even that sleepy and inert condition,
the advent of which seems to be the prime condition of
farther symptoms being developed, is said to be merely due
to the fact that the mind expects it to come; whilst its influence
on the other symptoms is not physiological, so to speak,
but psychical, its own easy realization by suggestion simply
encouraging the subject to expect that ulterior suggestions
will be realized with equal ease. The radical defenders of
the suggestion-theory are thus led to deny the very existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
of the hypnotic state, in the sense of a peculiar trance-like
condition which deprives the patient of spontaneity
and makes him passive to suggestion from without. The
trance itself is only one of the suggestions, and many subjects
in fact can be made to exhibit the other hypnotic
phenomena without the preliminary induction of this one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The theory of suggestion may be said to be quite triumphant
at the present day over the neurosis-theory as held
at the Salpétrière, with its three states, and its definite
symptoms supposed to be produced by physical agents
apart from co-operation of the subject's mind. But it
is one thing to say this, and it is quite another thing to
say that there is no peculiar physiological condition whatever
worthy of the name of hypnotic trance, no peculiar
state of nervous equilibrium, 'hypotaxy,' 'dissociation,' or
whatever you please to call it, during which the subject's
susceptibility to outward suggestion is greater than at ordinary
times. All the facts seem to prove that, until this
trance-like state is assumed by the patient, suggestion produces
very insignificant results, but that, when it is once
assumed, there are no limits to suggestion's power. The
state in question has many affinities with ordinary sleep.
It is probable, in fact, that we all pass through it transiently
whenever we fall asleep; and one might most naturally
describe the usual relation of operator and subject by
saying that the former keeps the latter suspended between
waking and sleeping by talking to him enough to keep his
slumber from growing profound, and yet not in such a way
as to wake him up. A hynotized patient, <i>left to himself,</i> will
either fall sound asleep or wake up entirely. The difficulty
in hypnotizing refractory persons is that of catching
them at the right moment of transition and making it permanent.
Fixing the eyes and relaxing the muscles of the
body produce the hypnotic state just as they facilitate the
advent of sleep. The first stages of ordinary sleep are characterized
by a peculiar dispersed attitude of the attention.
Images come before consciousness which are entirely incongruous
with our ordinary beliefs and habits of thought.
The latter either vanish altogether or withdraw, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
inertly into the background of the mind, and let the incongruous
images reign alone. These images acquire, moreover,
an exceptional vivacity; they become first 'hypnagogic
hallucinations,' and then, as the sleep grows deeper, dreams.
Now the 'mono-ideism,' or else the impotency and failure
to 'rally' on the part of the background-ideas, which thus
characterize somnolescence, are unquestionably the result
of a special physiological change occurring in the brain at
that time. Just so that similar mono-ideism, or dissociation
of the reigning fancy from those other thoughts which
might possibly act as its 'reductives,' which characterize
the hypnotic consciousness, must equally be due to a
special cerebral change. The term 'hypnotic trance,' which
I employ, tells us nothing of what the change is, but it
marks the fact that it exists, and is consequently a useful
expression. The great vivacity of the hypnotic images (as
gauged by their motor effects), the oblivion of them when
normal life is resumed, the abrupt awakening, the recollection
of them again in subsequent trances, the anæsthesia
and hyperæsthesia which are so frequent, all point away
from our simple waking credulity and 'suggestibility' as
the type by which the phenomena are to be interpreted,
and make us look rather towards sleep and dreaming, or
towards those deeper alterations of the personality known
as automatism, double consciousness, or 'second' personality
for the true analogues of the hypnotic trance.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> Even
the best hypnotic subjects pass through life without any
one suspecting them to possess such a remarkable susceptibility,
until by deliberate experiment it is made manifest.
The operator fixes their eyes or their attention a short time
to develop the propitious phase, holds them in it by his
talk, and <i>the state being there</i>, makes them the puppets of all
his suggestions. But no ordinary suggestions of waking life
ever took such control of their mind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The suggestion-theory may therefore be approved as correct,
provided we grant the trance-state as its prerequisite.</i> The
three states of Charcot, the strange reflexes of Heidenhain,
and all the other bodily phenomena which have been
called direct consequences of the trance-state itself, are not
such. They are products of suggestion, the trance-state
having no particular outward symptoms of its own; but
without the trance-state there, those particular suggestions
could never have been successfully made.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>


<h4>THE SYMPTOMS OF THE TRANCE.</h4>


<p>This accounts for the altogether indefinite array of symptoms
which have been gathered together as characteristic
of the hypnotic state. The law of habit dominates hypnotic
subjects even more than it does waking ones. Any sort of
personal peculiarity, any trick accidentally fallen into in
the first instance by some one subject, may, by attracting
attention, become stereotyped, serve as a pattern for imitation,
and figure as the type of a school. The first subject
trains the operator, the operator trains the succeeding
subjects, all of them in perfect good faith conspiring together
to evolve a perfectly arbitrary result. With the extraordinary
perspicacity and subtlety of perception which
subjects often display for all that concerns the operator
with whom they are <i>en rapport</i>, it is hard to keep them
ignorant of anything which he expects. Thus it happens
that one easily verifies on new subjects what one has
already seen on old ones, or any desired symptom of which
one may have heard or read.</p>

<p>The symptoms earliest observed by writers were all
thought to be typical. But with the multiplication of observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
phenomena, the importance of most particular symptoms
as marks of the state has diminished. This lightens
very much our own immediate task. Proceeding to enumerate
the symptoms of the hypnotic trance, I may confine
myself to those which are intrinsically interesting, or which
differ considerably from the normal functions of man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>First of all comes <i>amnesia</i>. In the earlier stages of hypnotism
the patient remembers what has happened, but with
successive sittings he sinks into a deeper condition, which
is commonly followed by complete loss of memory. He
may have been led through the liveliest hallucinations and
dramatic performances, and have exhibited the intensest apparent
emotion, but on waking he can recall nothing at all.
The same thing happens on waking from sleep in the midst
of a dream&mdash;it quickly eludes recall. But just as we may be
<i>reminded</i> of it, or of parts of it, by meeting persons or objects
which figured therein, so on being adroitly prompted,
the hypnotic patient will often remember what happened in
his trance. One cause of the forgetfulness seems to be
the disconnection of the trance performances with the system
of waking ideas. Memory requires a continuous train
of association. M. Delbœuf, reasoning in this way, woke
his subjects in the midst of an action begun during trance
(washing the hands, e.g.), and found that they then remembered
the trance. The act in question bridged over the two
states. But one can often make them remember by merely
telling them during the trance that they <i>shall</i> remember.
Acts of one trance, moreover, are usually recalled, either
spontaneously or at command, during another trance, provided
that the contents of the two trances be not mutually
incompatible.</p>

<p><i>Suggestibility.</i> The patient believes everything which
his hypnotizer tells him, and does everything which the
latter commands. Even results over which the will has
normally no control, such as sneezing, secretion, reddening
and growing pale, alterations of temperature and heart-beat,
menstruation, action of the bowels, etc., may take
place in consequence of the operator's firm assertions during
the hypnotic trance, and the resulting conviction on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
part of the subject, that the effects will occur. Since almost
all the phenomena yet to be described are effects of this
heightened suggestibility, I will say no more under the
general head, but proceed to illustrate the peculiarity in
detail.</p>

<p><i>Effects on the voluntary muscles</i> seem to be those most
easily got; and the ordinary routine of hypnotizing consists
in provoking them first. Tell the patient that he cannot
open his eyes or his mouth, cannot unclasp his hands
or lower his raised arm, cannot rise from his seat, or pick
up a certain object from the floor, and he will be immediately
smitten with absolute impotence in these regards.
The effect here is generally due to the <i>involuntary contraction</i>
of antagonizing muscles. But one can equally well
suggest <i>paralysis</i>, of an arm for example, in which case it
will hang perfectly placid by the subject's side. Cataleptic
and tetanic rigidity are easily produced by suggestion,
aided by handling the parts. One of the favorite shows at
public exhibitions is that of a subject stretched stiff as a
board with his head on one chair and his heels on another.
The cataleptic retention of impressed attitudes differs from
voluntary assumption of the same attitude. An arm voluntarily
held out straight will drop from fatigue after a
quarter of an hour at the utmost, and before it falls the
agent's distress will be made manifest by oscillations in the
arm, disturbances in the breathing, etc. But Charcot has
shown that an arm held out in hypnotic catalepsy, though
it may as soon descend, yet does so slowly and with no accompanying
vibration, whilst the breathing remains entirely
calm. He rightly points out that this shows a profound
physiological change, and is proof positive against simulation,
as far as this symptom is concerned. A cataleptic
attitude, moreover, may be held for many hours.&mdash;Sometimes
an expressive attitude, clinching of the fist, contraction
of the brows, will gradually set up a sympathetic
action of the other muscles of the body, so that at last a
<i>tableau vivant</i> of fear, anger, disdain, prayer, or other emotional
condition, is produced with rare perfection. This
effect would seem to be due to the suggestion of the mental
state by the first contraction. Stammering, aphasia, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
inability to utter certain words, pronounce certain letters,
are readily producible by suggestion.</p>

<p><i>Hallucinations</i> of all the senses and <i>delusions</i> of every
conceivable kind can be easily suggested to good subjects.
The emotional effects are then often so lively, and the pantomimic
display so expressive, that it is hard not to believe
in a certain 'psychic hyper-excitability,' as one of the concomitants
of the hypnotic condition. You can make the
subject think that he is freezing or burning, itching or
covered with dirt, or wet; you can make him eat a potato
for a peach, or drink a cup of vinegar for a glass of champagne;<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
ammonia will smell to him like cologne water; a
chair will be a lion, a broom-stick a beautiful woman, a
noise in the street will be an orchestral music, etc., etc.,
with no limit except your powers of invention and the
patience of the lookers on.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Illusions and hallucinations
form the <i>pièces de résistance</i> at public exhibitions. The
comic effect is at its climax when it is successfully suggested
to the subject that his personality is changed into
that of a baby, of a street boy, of a young lady dressing
for a party, of a stump orator, or of Napoleon the Great.
He may even be transformed into a beast, or an inanimate
thing like a chair or a carpet, and in every case will act
out all the details of the part with a sincerity and intensity
seldom seen at the theatre. The excellence of the
performance is in these cases the best reply to the suspicion
that the subject may be shamming&mdash;so skilful a shammer
must long since have found his true function in life upon
the stage. Hallucinations and histrionic delusions generally
go with a certain depth of the trance, and are followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
by complete forgetfulness. The subject awakens from
them at the command of the operator with a sudden start
of surprise, and may seem for a while a little dazed.</p>

<p>Subjects in this condition will receive and execute suggestions
of crime, and act out a theft, forgery, arson, or
murder. A girl will believe that she is married to her
hypnotizer, etc. It is unfair, however, to say that in these
cases the subject is a pure puppet with no spontaneity.
His spontaneity is certainly not in abeyance so far as
things go which are harmoniously associated with the suggestion
given him. He takes the text from his operator;
but he may amplify and develop it enormously as he acts
it out. His spontaneity is lost only for those systems of
ideas which <i>conflict</i> with the suggested delusion. The latter
is thus 'systematized'; the rest of consciousness is shut
off, excluded, dissociated from it. In extreme cases the
rest of the mind would seem to be actually abolished and
the hypnotic subject to be literally a changed personality,
a being in one of those 'second' states which we studied
in Chapter X. But the reign of the delusion is often
not as absolute as this. If the thing suggested be too intimately
repugnant, the subject may strenuously resist and
get nervously excited in consequence, even to the point of
having an hysterical attack. The conflicting ideas slumber
in the background and merely permit those in the foreground
to have their way until a <i>real</i> emergency arises;
then they assert their rights. As M. Delbœuf says, the
subject surrenders himself good-naturedly to the performance,
stabs with the pasteboard dagger you give him because
he knows what it is, and fires off the pistol because he
knows it has no ball; but for a real murder he would not
be your man. It is undoubtedly true that subjects are
often well aware that they are acting a part. They know
that what they do is absurd. They know that the hallucination
which they see, describe, and act upon, is not really
there. They may laugh at themselves; and they always
recognize the abnormality of their state when asked about
it, and call it 'sleep.' One often notices a sort of mocking
smile upon them, as if they were playing a comedy, and
they may even say on 'coming to' that they were shamming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
all the while. These facts have misled ultra-skeptical
people so far as to make them doubt the genuineness
of any hypnotic phenomena at all. But, save the consciousness
of 'sleep,' they do not occur in the deeper conditions;
and when they do occur they are only a natural
consequence of the fact that the 'monoideism' is incomplete.
The background-thoughts still exist, and have the
power of <i>comment</i> on the suggestions, but no power to inhibit
their motor and associative effects. A similar condition
is frequent enough in the waking state, when an
impulse carries us away and our 'will' looks on wonderingly
like an impotent spectator. These 'shammers' continue
to sham in just the same way, every new time you
hypnotize them, until at last they are forced to admit that
if shamming there be, it is something very different from
the free voluntary shamming of waking hours.</p>

<p><i>Real sensations may be abolished</i> as well as false ones
suggested. Legs and breasts may be amputated, children
born, teeth extracted, in short the most painful experiences
undergone, with no other anæsthetic than the hypnotizer's
assurance that no pain shall be felt. Similarly
morbid pains may be annihilated, neuralgias, toothaches,
rheumatisms cured. The sensation of hunger has thus
been abolished, so that a patient took no nourishment for
fourteen days. The most interesting of these suggested
anæsthesias are those limited to certain objects of perception.
Thus a subject may be made blind to a certain person
and to him alone, or deaf to certain words but to no
others.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> In this case the anæsthesia (or <i>negative hallucination</i>,
as it has been called) is apt to become <i>systematized</i>.
Other things related to the person to whom one has
been made blind may also be shut out of consciousness.
What he says is not heard, his contact is not felt, objects
which he takes from his pocket are not seen, etc. Objects
which he screens are seen as if he were transparent. Facts
about him are forgotten, his name is not recognized when
pronounced. Of course there is great variety in the completeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
of this systematic extension of the suggested
anæsthesia, but one may say that some tendency to it always
exists. When one of the subjects' own limbs is made anæsthetic,
for example, memories as well as sensations of its
movements often seem to depart. An interesting degree of
the phenomenon is found in the case related by M. Binet
of a subject to whom it was suggested that a certain M. C.
was invisible. She still saw M. C., but saw him as a
stranger, having lost the memory of his name and his existence.&mdash;Nothing
is easier than to make subjects forget their
own name and condition in life. It is one of the suggestions
which most promptly succeed, even with quite fresh
ones. A systematized amnesia of certain periods of one's
life may also be suggested, the subject placed, for instance,
where he was a decade ago with the intervening years obliterated
from his mind.</p>

<p>The mental condition which accompanies these systematized
anæsthesias and amnesias is a very curious one.
The anæsthesia is not a genuine sensorial one, for if you
make a real red cross (say) on a sheet of white paper invisible
to an hypnotic subject, and yet cause him to look
fixedly at a dot on the paper on or near the cross, he will,
on transferring his eye to a blank sheet, see a bluish-green
after-image of the cross. This proves that it has impressed
his sensibility. He has <i>felt</i> it, but not <i>perceived</i> it. He
had actively ignored it, refused to recognize it, as it were.
Another experiment proves that he must <i>distinguish</i> it first
in order thus to ignore it. Make a stroke on paper or
blackboard, and tell the subject it is not there, and he will
see nothing but the clean paper or board. Next, he not
looking, surround the original stroke with other strokes
exactly like it, and ask him what he sees. He will point
out one by one all the new strokes and omit the original
one every time, no matter how numerous the new strokes
may be, or in what order they are arranged. Similarly, if
the original single stroke to which he is blind be <i>doubled</i>
by a prism of sixteen degrees placed before one of his eyes
(both being kept open), he will say that he now sees <i>one</i>
stroke, and point in the direction in which the image seen
through the prism lies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span></p>
<p>Obviously, then, he is not blind to the <i>kind</i> of stroke in
the least. He is blind only to one individual stroke of
that kind in a particular position on the board or paper,&mdash;that
is, to a particular complex object; and, paradoxical as
it may seem to say so, he must distinguish it with great
accuracy from others like it, in order to remain blind
to it when the others are brought near. He 'apperceives'
it, as a preliminary to not seeing it at all! How to conceive
of this state of mind is not easy. It would be much
simpler to understand the process, if adding new strokes
made the first one visible. There would then be two different
objects apperceived as totals,&mdash;paper with one
stroke, paper with two strokes; and, blind to the former,
he would see all that was <i>in</i> the latter, because he would
have apperceived it as a different total in the first instance.</p>

<p>A process of this sort occurs sometimes (not always)
when the new strokes, instead of being mere repetitions of
the original one, are lines which combine with it into a
total object, say a human face. The subject of the trance
then may regain his sight of the line to which he had previously
been blind, by seeing it as part of the face.</p>

<p>When by a prism before one eye a previously invisible
line has been made visible to that eye, and the other eye is
closed or screened, <i>its</i> closure makes no difference; the
line still remains visible. But if <i>then</i> the prism is removed,
the line will disappear even to the eye which a moment
ago saw it, and both eyes will revert to their original blind
state.</p>

<p>We have, then, to deal in these cases neither with a
sensorial anæsthesia, nor with a mere failure to notice,
but with something much more complex; namely, an
active counting out and positive exclusion of certain objects.
It is as when one 'cuts' an acquaintance, 'ignores'
a claim, or 'refuses to be influenced' by a consideration of
whose existence one remains aware. Thus a lover of Nature
in America finds himself able to overlook and ignore
entirely the board- and rail-fences and general roadside
raggedness, and revel in the beauty and picturesqueness of
the other elements of the landscape, whilst to a newly-arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
European the fences are so aggressively present as
to spoil enjoyment.</p>

<p>Messrs. Gurney, Janet, and Binet have shown that the
ignored elements are preserved in a split-off portion of the
subjects' consciousness which can be tapped in certain ways,
and made to give an account of itself (see Vol. I. p. 209).</p>

<p><i>Hyperæsthesia of the senses</i> is as common a symptom as
anæsthesia. On the skin two points can be discriminated
at less than the normal distance. The sense of touch is so
delicate that (as M. Delbœuf informs me) a subject after
simply poising on her finger-tips a blank card drawn from
a pack of similar ones can pick it out from the pack again
by its 'weight.' We approach here the line where, to many
persons, it seems as if something more than the ordinary
senses, however sharpened, were required in explanation.
I have seen a coin from the operator's pocket repeatedly
picked out by the subject from a heap of twenty others,<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
by its greater 'weight' in the subject's language.&mdash;Auditory
hyperæsthesia may enable a subject to hear a watch
tick, or his operator speak, in a distant room.&mdash;One of the
most extraordinary examples of visual hyperæsthesia is
that reported by Bergson, in which a subject who seemed
to be reading through the back of a book held and looked
at by the operator, was really proved to be reading the image
of the page reflected on the latter's cornea. The same
subject was able to discriminate with the naked eye details
in a microscopic preparation. Such cases of 'hyperæsthesia
of vision' as that reported by Taguet and Sauvaire,
where subjects could see things mirrored by non-reflecting
bodies, or through opaque pasteboard, would seem rather
to belong to 'psychical research', than to the present category.&mdash;The
ordinary test of visual hyperacuteness in hypnotism
is the favorite trick of giving a subject the hallucination
of a picture on a blank sheet of card-board, and
then mixing the latter with a lot of other similar sheets.
The subject will always find the picture on the original
sheet again, and recognize infallibly if it has been turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
over, or upside down, although the bystanders have to resort
to artifice to identify it again. The Subject notes peculiarities
on the card, too small for waking observation to
detect.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> If it be said that the spectators guide him by
their manner, their breathing, etc., that is only another
proof of his hyperæsthesia; for he undoubtedly <i>is</i> conscious
of subtler personal indications (of his operator's
mental states especially) than he could notice in his waking
state. Examples of this are found in the so-called 'magnetic
<i>rapport</i>.' This is a name for the fact that in deep
trance, or in lighter trance whenever the suggestion is
made, the subject is deaf and blind to everyone but the
operator or those spectators to whom the latter expressly
awakens his senses. The most violent appeals from anyone
else are for him as if non-existent, whilst he obeys the
faintest signals on the part of his hypnotizer. If in catalepsy,
his limbs will retain their attitude only when the
operator moves them; when others move them they fall
down, etc. A more remarkable fact still is that the patient
will often answer anyone whom his operator touches, or at
whom he even points his finger, in however concealed a
manner. All which is rationally explicable by expectation
and suggestion, if only it be farther admitted that his
senses are acutely sharpened for all the operator's movements.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
He often shows great anxiety and restlessness if
the latter is out of the room. A favorite experiment of
Mr. E. Gurney's was to put the subject's hands through an
opaque screen, and cause the operator to point at one
finger. <i>That</i> finger presently grew insensible or rigid. A
bystander pointing simultaneously at another finger, never
made that insensible or rigid. Of course the elective <i>rapport</i>
with their operator had been developed in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
trained subjects during the hypnotic state, but the phenomenon
then occurred in some of them during the waking
state, even when their consciousness was absorbed in animated
conversation with a fourth party.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> I confess that
when I saw these experiments I was impressed with the
necessity for admitting between the <i>emanations</i> from different
people differences for which we have no name, and a
discriminative sensibility for them of the nature of which
we can form no clear conception, but which seems to be
developed in certain subjects by the hypnotic trance.&mdash;The
enigmatic reports of the effect of magnets and metals, even
if they be due, as many contend, to unintentional suggestion
on the operator's part, certainly involve hyperæsthetic
perception, for the operator seeks as well as possible to
conceal the moment when the magnet is brought into play,
and yet the subject not only finds it out that moment in a
way difficult to understand, but may develop effects which
(in the first instance certainly) the operator did not expect to
find. Unilateral contractures, movements, paralyses, hallucinations,
etc., are made to pass to the other side of the
body, hallucinations to disappear, or to change to the complementary
color, suggested emotions to pass into their
opposites, etc. Many Italian observations agree with the
French ones, and the upshot is that if unconscious suggestion
lie at the bottom of this matter, the patients show an
enormously exalted power of divining what it is they are
expected to do. This hyperæsthetic perception is what
concerns us now.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Its <i>modus</i> cannot yet be said to be defined.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Changes in the nutrition of the tissues</i> may be produced by
suggestion. These effects lead into therapeutics&mdash;a subject
which I do not propose to treat of here. But I may say
that there seems no reasonable ground for doubting that in
certain chosen subjects the suggestion of a congestion, a
burn, a blister, a raised papule, or a bleeding from the nose
or skin, may produce the effect. Messrs. Beaunis, Berjon,
Bernheim, Bourru, Burot, Charcot, Delbœuf, Dumontpallier,
Focachon, Forel, Jendrássik, Krafft-Ebing, Liébeault,
Liégeois, Lipp, Mabille, and others have recently vouched
for one or other of these effects. Messrs. Delbœuf and
Liégeois have annulled by suggestion, one the effects of a
burn, the other of a blister. Delbœuf was led to his experiments
after seeing a burn on the skin produced by suggestion,
at the Salpétrière, by reasoning that if the idea of a pain
could produce inflammation it must be because pain was
itself an inflammatory irritant, and that the abolition of it
from a real burn ought therefore to entail the absence of
inflammation. He applied the actual cautery (as well as vesicants)
to symmetrical places on the skin, affirming that no
pain should be felt on one of the sides. The result was a
dry scorch on that side, with (as he assures me) no after-mark,
but on the other side a regular blister with suppuration
and a subsequent scar. This explains the innocuity of
certain assaults made on subjects during trance. To test
simulation, recourse is often had to sticking pins under their
finger-nails or through their tongue, to inhalations of strong
ammonia, and the like. These irritations, when not felt by
the subject, seem to leave no after-consequences. One is
reminded of the reported non-inflammatory character of the
wounds made on themselves by dervishes in their pious orgies.
On the other hand, the reddenings and bleedings of the
skin along certain lines, suggested by tracing lines or pressing
objects thereupon, put the accounts handed down to us of
the stigmata of the cross appearing on the hands, feet, sides,
and forehead of certain Catholic mystics in a new light.
As so often happens, a fact is denied until a welcome interpretation
comes with it. Then it is admitted readily enough;
and evidence judged quite insufficient to back a claim, so
long as the church had an interest in making it, proves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
be quite sufficient for modern scientific enlightenment, the
moment it appears that a reputed saint can thereby be
classed as 'a case of hystero-epilepsy.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There remain two other topics, viz., post-hypnotic effects
of suggestion, and effects of suggestion in the waking
state.</p>

<p><i>Post-hypnotic, or deferred, suggestions</i> are such as are
given to the patients during trance, to take effect after waking.
They succeed with a certain number of patients even
when the execution is named for a remote period&mdash;months
or even a year, in one case reported by M. Liégeois. In
this way one can make the patient feel a pain, or be paralyzed,
or be hungry or thirsty, or have an hallucination,
positive or negative, or perform some fantastic action after
emerging from his trance. The effect in question may be
ordered to take place not immediately, but after an interval
of time has elapsed, and the interval may be left to the
subject to measure, or may be marked by a certain signal.
The moment the signal occurs, or the time is run out, the
subject, who until then seems in a perfectly normal waking
condition, will experience the suggested effect. In many
instances, whilst thus obedient to the suggestion, he
seems to fall into the hypnotic condition again. This is
proved by the fact that the moment the hallucination or suggested
performance is over he forgets it, denies all knowledge
of it, and so forth; and by the further fact that he is
'suggestible' during its performance, that is, will receive
new hallucinations, etc., at command. A moment later and
this suggestibility has disappeared. It cannot be said, however,
that relapse into the trance is an absolutely necessary
condition for the post-hypnotic carrying out of commands,
for the subject may be neither suggestible nor amnesic, and
may struggle with all the strength of his will against the
absurdity of this impulse which he feels rising in him, he
knows not why. In these cases, as in most cases, he forgets
the circumstance of the impulse having been suggested to
him in a previous trance; regards it as arising within himself;
and often improvises, as he yields to it, some more or
less plausible or ingenious motive by which to justify it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
the lookers-on. He acts, in short, with his usual sense of personal
spontaneity and freedom; and the disbelievers in the
freedom of the will have naturally made much of these cases
in their attempts to show it to be an illusion.</p>

<p>The only really mysterious feature of these deferred suggestions
is the patient's absolute ignorance during the interval
preceding their execution that they have been deposited
in his mind. They will often surge up at the preappointed
time, even though you have vainly tried a while before to
make him recall the circumstances of their production. The
most important class of post-hypnotic suggestions are, of
course, those relative to the patient's health&mdash;bowels, sleep,
and other bodily functions. Among the most <i>interesting</i>
(apart from the hallucinations) are those relative to future
trances. One can determine the hour and minute, or the
signal, at which the patient will of his own accord lapse into
trance again. One can make him susceptible in future to
another operator who may have been unsuccessful with him
in the past. Or more important still in certain cases, one
can, by suggesting that certain persons shall never be able
hereafter to put him to sleep, remove him for all future time
from hypnotic influences which might be dangerous. This,
indeed, is the simple and natural safeguard against those
'dangers of hypnotism' of which uninstructed persons talk
so vaguely. A subject who knows himself to be ultra-susceptible
should never allow himself to be entranced by an
operator in whose moral delicacy he lacks complete confidence;
and he can use a trusted operator's suggestions to
protect himself against liberties which others, knowing his
weakness, might be tempted to take with him.</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the command is retained until
the moment for its execution arrives is a mystery which has
given rise to much discussion. The experiments of Gurney
and the observations of M. Pierre Janet and others on certain
hysterical somnabulists seem to prove that it is stored
up in consciousness; not simply organically registered, but
that <i>the consciousness which thus retains it is split off, dissociated
from the rest of the subject's mind.</i> We have here, in short, an
experimental production of one of those 'second' states of the
personality of which we have spoken so often. Only here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
second state coexists as well as alternates with the first.
Gurney had the brilliant idea of <i>tapping</i> this second consciousness
by means of the planchette. He found that
certain persons, who were both hypnotic subjects and automatic
writers, would if their hands were placed on a planchette
(after being wakened from a trance in which they had
received the suggestion of something to be done at a later
time) write out unconsciously the order, or something connected
with it. This shows that something inside of them,
which could express itself through the hand alone, was
continuing to think of the order, and possibly of it alone.
These researches have opened a new vista of possible experimental
investigations into the so-called 'second' states
of the personality.</p>

<p>Some subjects seem almost as obedient to suggestion in
the waking state as in sleep, or even more so, according to
certain observers. Not only muscular phenomena, but
changes of personality and hallucinations are recorded as
the result of simple affirmation on the operator's part, without
the previous ceremony of 'magnetizing' or putting into
the 'mesmeric sleep.' These are all trained subjects, however,
so far as I know, and the affirmation must apparently
be accompanied by the patient concentrating his attention
and gazing, however briefly, into the eyes of the operator.
It is probable therefore that an extremely rapidly induced
condition of trance is a prerequisite for success in these
experiments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have now made mention of all the more important
phenomena of the hypnotic trance. Of their therapeutic
or forensic bearings this is not the proper place to speak.
The recent literature of the subject is quite voluminous, but
much of it consists in repetition. The best compendious
work on the subject is 'Der Hypnotismus,' by Dr. A. Moll
(Berlin, 1889; and just translated into English, N. Y., 1890),
which is extraordinarily complete and judicious. The other
writings most recommendable are subjoined in the note.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
Most of them contain a historical sketch and much bibliography.
A complete bibliography has been published
by M. Dessoir (Berlin, 1888).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_513_513" id="Footnote_513_513"></a><a href="#FNanchor_513_513"><span class="label">[513]</span></a> It should be said that the methods of leaving the patient to himself, and
that of the simple verbal suggestion of sleep (the so-called Nancy method
introduced by Liébeault of that place), seem, wherever applicable, to be
the best, as they entail none of the after-inconveniences which occasionally
follow upon straining his eyes. A new patient should not be put through
a great variety of different suggestions in immediate succession. He should
be waked up from time to time, and then rehypnotized to avoid mental
confusion and excitement. Before finally waking a subject you should
<i>undo</i> whatever delusive suggestions you may have implanted in him, by telling
him that they are all gone, etc., and that you are now going to restore
him to his natural state. Headache, languor, etc., which sometimes follow
the first trance or two, must be banished at the outset, by the operator
strongly assuring the subject that such things <i>never</i> come from hypnotism,
that the subject <i>must not</i> have them, etc.</p></div>

<h4>NECESSARY TRUTHS AND THE EFFECTS OF EXPERIENCE.</h4>


<p>In this final chapter I shall treat of what has sometimes
been called <i>psychogenesis</i>, and try to ascertain just how far
the connections of things in the outward environment can
account for our tendency to think of, and to react upon,
certain things in certain ways and in no others, even though
personally we have had of the things in question no experience,
or almost no experience, at all. It is a familiar
truth that some propositions are <i>necessary</i>. We <i>must</i> attach
the predicate 'equal' to the subject 'opposite sides of a
parallelogram' if we think those terms together at all,
whereas we need not in any such way attach the predicate
'rainy,' for example, to the subject 'to-morrow.' The dubious
sort of coupling of terms is universally admitted to be due
to 'experience'; the certain sort is ascribed to the 'organic
structure' of the mind. This structure is in turn supposed
by the so-called <i>apriorists</i> to be of transcendental origin, or
at any rate not to be explicable by experience; whilst by
evolutionary empiricists it is supposed to be also due to experience,
only not to the experience of the individual, but
to that of his ancestors as far back as one may please to
go. Our emotional and instinctive tendencies, our irresistible
impulses to couple certain movements with the perception
or thought of certain things, are also features of our
connate mental structure, and like the necessary judgments,
are interpreted by the apriorists and the empiricists in the
same warring ways.</p>

<p>I shall try in the course of the chapter to make plain
three things:</p>

<p>1) That, taking the word experience as it is universally
understood, the experience of the race can no more account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
for our necessary or <i>a priori</i> judgments than the experience
of the individual can;</p>

<p>2) That there is no good evidence for the belief that
our instinctive reactions are fruits of our ancestors' education
in the midst of the same environment, transmitted to
us at birth.</p>

<p>3) That the features of our organic mental structure
cannot be explained at all by our conscious intercourse
with the outer environment, but must rather be understood
as congenital variations, 'accidental'<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> in the first instance,
but then transmitted as fixed features of the race.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, the account which the apriorists
give of the <i>facts</i> is that which I defend; although I should
contend (as will hereafter appear) for a naturalistic view
of their <i>cause</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first thing I have to say is that all schools (however
they otherwise differ) must allow that the <i>elementary
qualities</i> of cold, heat, pleasure, pain, red, blue, sound,
silence, etc., are original, innate, or <i>a priori</i> properties of our
subjective nature, even though they should require the touch
of experience to waken them into actual consciousness,
and should slumber, to all eternity, without it.</p>

<p>This is so on either of the two hypotheses we may
make concerning the relation of the feelings to the
realities at whose touch they become alive. For in the
first place, if a feeling do <i>not</i> mirror the reality which
wakens it and to which we say it corresponds, if it mirror
no reality whatever outside of the mind, it of course is a
purely mental product. By its very definition it can be
nothing else. But in the second place, even if it <i>do</i> mirror
the reality exactly, still it <i>is</i> not that reality itself, it is a
duplication of it, the result of a mental reaction. And that
the mind should have the power of reacting in just that
duplicate way can only be stated as a <i>harmony</i> between its
nature and the nature of the truth outside of it, a harmony
whereby it follows that the qualities of both parties match.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span></p>
<p>The originality of these <i>elements</i> is not, then, a question
for dispute. <i>The warfare of philosophers is exclusively relative
to their</i> <span class="smcap">forms of combination</span>. The empiricist maintains
that these forms can only follow the order of combination
in which the elements were originally awakened
by the impressions of the external world; the apriorists
insist, on the contrary, that <i>some</i> modes of combination, at
any rate, follow from the natures of the elements themselves,
and that no amount of experience can modify this
result.</p>


<h4>WHAT IS MEANT BY EXPERIENCE?</h4>

<p>The phrase 'organic mental structure' names the matter
in dispute. Has the mind such a structure or not?
Are its contents <i>arranged</i> from the start, or is the arrangement
they may possess simply due to the shuffling of them
by experience in an absolutely plastic bed? Now the first
thing to make sure of is that when we talk of 'experience,'
we attach a definite meaning to the word. <i>Experience means
experience of something foreign supposed to impress us,</i> whether
spontaneously or in consequence of our own exertions and
acts. Impressions, as we well know, affect certain orders of
sequence and coexistence, and the mind's habits copy the
habits of the impressions, so that our images of things
assume a time- and space-arrangement which resembles
the time- and space-arrangements outside. To uniform
outer coexistences and sequences correspond constant conjunctions
of ideas, to fortuitous coexistences and sequences
casual conjunctions of ideas. We are sure that fire will
burn and water wet us, less sure that thunder will come
after lightning, not at all sure whether a strange dog will
bark at us or let us go by. In these ways experience
moulds us every hour, and makes of our minds a mirror of
the time- and space-connections between the things in the
world. The principle of habit within us so <i>fixes</i> the copy
at last that we find it difficult even to imagine how the outward
order could possibly be different from what it is, and
we continually divine from the present what the future is
to be. These habits of transition, from one thought to
another, are features of mental structure which were lacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
in us at birth; we can see their growth under experience's
moulding finger, and we can see how often experience
undoes her own work, and for an earlier order substitutes
a new one. '<i>The order of experience</i>,' in this matter of the
time- and space-conjunctions of things, is thus an indisputably
<i>vera causa</i> of our forms of thought. It is our educator,
our sovereign helper and friend; and its name,
standing for something with so real and definite a use,
ought to be kept sacred and encumbered with no vaguer
meaning.</p>

<p>If <i>all</i> the connections among ideas in the mind could
be interpreted as so many combinations of sense-data
wrought into fixity in this way from without, then experience
in the common and legitimate sense of the word would
be the sole fashioner of the mind.</p>

<p>The empirical school in psychology has in the main
contended that they can be so interpreted. Before our
generation, it was the experience of the individual only
which was meant. But when one nowadays says that the
human mind owes its present shape to experience, he means
the experience of ancestors as well. Mr. Spencer's statement
of this is the earliest emphatic one, and deserves
quotation in full:<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The supposition that the inner cohesions are adjusted to the outer
persistences by <i>accumulated</i> experience of those outer persistences is in
harmony with all our actual knowledge of mental phenomena. Though
in so far as reflex actions and instincts are concerned, the experience-hypothesis
seems insufficient; yet its seeming insufficiency occurs only
where the evidence is beyond our reach. Nay, even here such few facts
as we can get point to the conclusion that automatic psychical connections
result from the registration of <i>experiences continued for numberless
generations</i>.</p>

<p>"In brief, the case stands thus: It is agreed that all psychical
relations, save the absolutely indissoluble, are determined by experiences.
Their various strengths are admitted, other things equal, to be proportionate
to the <i>multiplication of experiences</i>. It is an unavoidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
corollary that an <i>infinity of experiences</i> will produce a psychical relation
that is indissoluble. Though such infinity of experiences cannot be
received by a single individual, yet it may be received by the succession
of individuals forming a race. And if there is a transmission of induced
tendencies in the nervous system, it is inferrible that <i>all psychical relations
whatever</i>, from the necessary to the fortuitous, result from the
experiences of the corresponding external relations; and are so brought
into harmony with them.</p>

<p>"Thus, the experience-hypothesis furnishes an adequate solution.
The genesis of instinct, the development of memory and reason out of
it, and the consolidation of rational actions and inferences into instinctive
ones, are alike explicable on the <i>single principle</i> that the
cohesion between psychical states is proportionate to the <i>frequency</i> with
which the relation between the answering external phenomena has been
<i>repeated in experience</i>.</p>

<p>"The <i>universal law</i> that, other things equal, the cohesion of psychical
states is proportionate to the <i>frequency</i> with which they have
followed one another in experience, supplies an explanation of the so-called
'forms of thought,' as soon as it is supplemented by the law that
<i>habitual</i> psychical successions entail some hereditary tendency to such
successions, which, under persistent conditions, will become cumulative
in generation after generation. We saw that the establishment of those
compound reflex actions called instincts is comprehensible on the principle
that inner relations are, <i>by perpetual repetition,</i> organized into
correspondence with outer relations. We have now to observe that the
establishment of those consolidated, those indissoluble, those instinctive
mental relations constituting our ideas of Space and Time is comprehensible
on the same principle. For if even to external relations
that are <i>often</i> experienced during the life of a single organism, answering
internal relations are established that become next to automatic&mdash;if
such a combination of psychical changes as that which guides a savage
in hitting a bird with an arrow becomes, by constant repetition, so organized
as to be performed almost without thought of the processes of
adjustment gone through&mdash;and if skill of this kind is so far transmissible
that particular races of men become characterized by particular aptitudes,
which are nothing else than partially-organized psychical connections;
then, if there exist certain external relations which are
experienced by all organisms at all instants of their waking lives&mdash;relations
which are absolutely constant, absolutely universal&mdash;there will
be established answering internal relations that are absolutely constant,
absolutely universal. Such relations we have in those of Space and
Time. The organization of subjective relations adjusted to these objective
relations has been cumulative, not in each race of creatures only,
but throughout successive races of creatures; and such subjective relations
have, therefore, become more consolidated than all others. Being
experienced in every perception and every action of each creature, these
connections among outer existences must, for this reason too, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
responded to by connections among inner feelings, that are, above all
others, indissoluble. As the substrata of all other relations in the <i>non-ego</i>,
they must be responded to by conceptions that are the substrata of
all other relations in the <i>ego</i>. Being the <i>constant and infinitely-repeated</i>
elements of thought, they must become the automatic elements
of thought&mdash;the elements of thought which it is impossible to get rid of&mdash;the
'forms of intuition.'</p>

<p>"Such, it seems to me, is the only possible reconciliation between the
experience-hypothesis and the hypothesis of the transcendentalists;
neither of which is tenable by itself. Insurmountable difficulties are
presented by the Kantian doctrine (as we shall hereafter see); and the
antagonist doctrine, taken alone, presents difficulties that are equally
insurmountable. To rest with the unqualified assertion that, antecedent
to experience, the mind is a blank, is to ignore the questions&mdash;whence
comes the power of organizing experiences? whence arise the different
degrees of that power possessed by different races of organisms, and
different individuals of the same race? If, at birth, there exists nothing
but a passive receptivity of impressions, why is not a horse as
educable as a man? Should it be said that language makes the difference,
then why do not the cat and the dog, reared in the same household,
arrive at equal degrees and kinds of intelligence? Understood in
its current form, the experience-hypothesis implies that the presence of
a definitely-organized nervous system is a circumstance of no moment&mdash;a
fact not needing to be taken into account! Yet it is the all-important
fact&mdash;the fact to which, in one sense, the criticisms of Leibnitz and
others pointed&mdash;the fact without which an assimilation of experiences
is inexplicable. Throughout the animal kingdom in general, the
actions are dependent on the nervous structure. The physiologist shows
us that each reflex movement implies the agency of certain nerves and
ganglia; that a development of complicated instincts is accompanied by
complication of the nervous centres and their commissural connections;
that the same creature in different stages, as larva and imago for
example, changes its instincts as its nervous structure changes; and
that as we advance to creatures of high intelligence, a vast increase in
the size and in the complexity of the nervous system takes place. What
is the obvious inference? It is that the ability to co-ordinate impressions
and to perform the appropriate actions always implies the pre-existence
of certain nerves arranged in a certain way. What is the
meaning of the human brain? It is that the many <i>established</i> relations
among its parts stand for so many <i>established</i> relations among the psychical
changes. Each of the constant connections among the fibres of
the cerebral masses answers to some <i>constant connection</i> of phenomena
in the experiences of the race. Just as the organized arrangement subsisting
between the sensory nerves of the nostrils and the motor nerves
of the respiratory muscles not only makes possible a sneeze, but also,
in the newly-born infant, implies sneezings to be hereafter performed;
so, all the organized arrangements subsisting among the nerves of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
infant's brain not only make possible certain combinations of impressions,
but also imply that such combinations will hereafter be made&mdash;imply
that there are answering combinations in the outer world&mdash;imply
a preparedness to cognize these combinations&mdash;imply faculties of comprehending
them. It is true that the resulting compound psychical
changes do not take place with the same readiness and automatic precision
as the simple reflex action instanced&mdash;it is true that some individual
experiences seem required to establish them. But while this is
partly due to the fact that these combinations are highly involved,
extremely varied in their modes of occurrence, made up therefore of
psychical relations less completely coherent, and hence need further
repetitions to perfect them; it is in a much greater degree due to the
fact that at birth the organization of the brain is incomplete, and does
not cease its spontaneous progress for twenty or thirty years afterwards.
Those who contend that knowledge results wholly from the experiences
of the individual, ignoring as they do the mental evolution which
accompanies the autogenous development of the nervous system, fall into
an error as great as if they were to ascribe all bodily growth and structure
to exercise, forgetting the innate tendency to assume the adult
form. Were the infant born with a full-sized and completely-constructed
brain, their position would be less untenable. But, as the case stands,
the gradually-increasing intelligence displayed throughout childhood
and youth is more attributable to the completion of the cerebral organization
than to the individual experiences&mdash;a truth proved by the fact
that in adult life there is sometimes displayed a high endowment of
some faculty which, during education, was never brought into play.
Doubtless, experiences received by the individual furnish the concrete
materials for all thought. Doubtless, the organized and semi-organized
arrangements existing among the cerebral nerves can give no knowledge
until there has been a presentation of the external relations to which
they correspond. And doubtless the child's daily observations and
reasonings aid the formation of those involved nervous connections that
are in process of spontaneous evolution; just as its daily gambols aid
the development of its limbs. But saying this is quite a different thing
from saying that its intelligence is wholly <i>produced</i> by its experiences.
That is an utterly inadmissible doctrine&mdash;a doctrine which makes the
presence of a brain meaningless&mdash;a doctrine which makes idiotcy unaccountable.</p>

<p>"In the sense, then, that there exist in the nervous system certain
pre-established relations answering to relations in the environment,
there is truth in the doctrine of 'forms of intuition'&mdash;not the truth
which its defenders suppose, but a parallel truth. Corresponding to
absolute external relations, there are established in the structure of the
nervous system absolute internal relations&mdash;relations that are potentially
present before birth in the shape of definite nervous connections; that
are antecedent to, and independent of, individual experiences; and
that are automatically disclosed along with the first cognitions. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
as here understood, it is not only these fundamental relations which
are thus predetermined, but also hosts of other relations of a more or
less constant kind, which are congenitally represented by more or less
complete nervous connections. But these predetermined internal
relations, though independent of the experiences of the individual, are
not independent of experiences in general: they have been determined
by the experiences of preceding organisms. The corollary here drawn
from the general argument is that the human brain is an organized
register of <i>infinitely-numerous</i> experiences received during the evolution
of life, or rather during the evolution of that series of organisms
through which the human organism has been reached. The effects of
the most <i>uniform and frequent</i> of these experiences have been successively
bequeathed, principal and interest; and have slowly amounted
to that high intelligence which lies latent in the brain of the infant&mdash;which
the infant in after-life exercises and perhaps strengthens or further
complicates&mdash;and which, with minute additions, it bequeaths to
future generations. And thus it happens that the European inherits
from twenty to thirty cubic inches more brain than the Papuan. Thus
it happens that faculties, as of music, which scarcely exist in some
inferior human races, become congenital in superior ones. Thus it happens
that out of savages unable to count up to the number of their fingers,
and speaking a language containing only nouns and verbs, arise
at length our Newtons and Shakspeares."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a brilliant and seductive statement, and it
doubtless includes a good deal of truth. Unfortunately it
fails to go into details; and when the details are scrutinized,
as they soon must be by us, many of them will be seen to
be inexplicable in this simple way, and the choice will then
remain to us either of denying the experiential origin of
certain of our judgments, or of enlarging the meaning of the
word experience so as to include these cases among its
effects.</p>


<h4>TWO MODES OF ORIGIN OF BRAIN STRUCTURE.</h4>


<p>If we adopt the former course we meet with a controversial
difficulty. The 'experience-philosophy' has from
time immemorial been the opponent of theological modes
of thought. The word experience has a halo of anti-supernaturalism
about it; so that if anyone express dissatisfaction
with any function claimed for it, he is liable to be
treated as if he could only be animated by loyalty to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
catechism, or in some way have the interests of obscurantism
at heart. I am entirely certain that, on this ground
alone, what I have erelong to say will make this a sealed
chapter to many of my readers. "He denies experience!"
they will exclaim, "denies science; believes the mind created
by miracle; is a regular old partisan of innate ideas! That is
enough! we'll listen to such antediluvian twaddle no more."
Regrettable as is the loss of readers capable of such
wholesale discipleship, I feel that a definite meaning for the
word experience is even more important than their company.
'Experience' does not mean every natural, as opposed to
every supernatural, cause. It means a particular sort of
natural agency, alongside of which other more recondite
natural agencies may perfectly well exist. With the scientific
animus of anti-supernaturalism we ought to agree, but
we ought to free ourselves from its verbal idols and
bugbears.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nature has many methods of producing the same effect.
She may make a 'born' draughtsman or singer by tipping
in a certain direction at an opportune moment the molecules
of some human ovum; or she may bring forth a
child ungifted and make him spend laborious but successful
years at school. She may make our ears ring by the sound
of a bell, or by a dose of quinine; make us see yellow by
spreading a field of buttercups before our eyes, or by
mixing a little santonine powder with our food; fill us with
terror of certain surroundings by making them really dangerous,
or by a blow which produces a pathological alteration
of our brain. It is obvious that we need two words
to designate these two modes of operating. <i>In the one case
the natural agents produce perceptions which take cognizance of
the agents themselves; in the other case, they produce perceptions
which take cognizance of something else.</i> What is taught
to the mind by the 'experience,' in the first case, is the
<i>order of the experience itself</i>&mdash;the 'inner relation' (in
Spencer's phrase) 'corresponds' to the 'outer relation'
which produced it, by remembering and knowing the latter.
But in the case of the <i>other</i> sort of natural agency, what is
taught to the mind has nothing to do with the agency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
itself, but with some different outer relation altogether. A
diagram will express the alternatives. B stands for our
human brain in the midst of the world. All the little <i>o</i>'s
with arrows proceeding from them are natural objects (like
sunsets, etc.), which impress it through the senses, and in
the strict sense of the word give it <i>experience</i>, teaching it by
habit and association what is the order of their ways. All
the little <i>x</i>'s inside the brain and all the little <i>x's</i> outside
of it are other natural objects and processes (in the ovum,
in the blood, etc.), which equally modify the brain, but
mould it to no cognition of <i>themselves</i>. The <i>tinnitus aurium</i>
discloses no properties of the quinine; the musical endowment
teaches no embryology; the morbid dread (of solitude,
perhaps) no brain-pathology; but the way in which a dirty
sunset and a rainy morrow hang together in the mind copies
and teaches the sequences of sunsets and rainfall in the
outer world.</p>

animal race may grow to be a better match for its environment.</p>

<p>First, the so-called way of 'adaptation,' in which the
environment may itself modify its inhabitant by exercising,
hardening, and habituating him to certain sequences,
and these habits may, it is often maintained, become hereditary.</p>

<p>Second, the way of 'accidental variation,' as Mr. Darwin
termed it, in which certain young are born with peculiarities
that help them and their progeny to survive. That variations
of <i>this</i> sort tend to become hereditary, no one doubts.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span></p>
<p>The first mode is called by Mr. Spencer direct, the
second indirect, equilibration. Both equilibrations must
of course be natural and physical processes, but they
belong to entirely different physical spheres. The direct
influences are obvious and accessible things. The causes
of variation in the young are, on the other hand, molecular
and hidden. The direct influences are the animal's 'experiences,'
in the widest sense of the term. Where what
is influenced by them is the <i>mental</i> organism, they are <i>conscious</i>
experiences, and become the <i>objects</i> as well as the
causes of their effects. That is, the effect consists in a tendency
of the experience itself to be remembered, or to have
its elements thereafter coupled in imagination just as they
were coupled in the experience. In the diagram these experiences
are represented by the <i>o</i>'s exclusively. The <i>x</i>'s,
on the other hand, stand for the indirect causes of mental
modification&mdash;causes of which we are not immediately conscious
as such, and which are not the direct <i>objects</i> of the
effects they produce. Some of them are molecular accidents
before birth; some of them are collateral and remote
combinations, unintended combinations, one might say, of
more direct effects wrought in the unstable and intricate
brain-tissue. Such a result is unquestionably the susceptibility
to music, which some individuals possess at the present
day. It has no zoological utility; it corresponds to no
object in the natural environment; it is a pure <i>incident</i> of
having a hearing organ, an incident depending on such instable
and inessential conditions that one brother may have
it and another brother not. Just so with the susceptibility
to sea-sickness, which, so far from being engendered by
long experience of its 'object' (if a heaving deck can be
called its object) is erelong annulled thereby. Our higher
æsthetic, moral, and intellectual life seems made up of
affections of this collateral and incidental sort, which have
entered the mind by the back stairs, as it were, or rather
have not entered the mind at all, but got surreptitiously born
in the house. No one can successfully treat of psychogenesis,
or the factors of mental evolution, without distinguishing
between these two ways in which the mind is assailed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
The way of 'experience' proper is the front door, the door
of the five senses. The agents which affect the brain in
this way immediately become the mind's <i>objects</i>. The other
agents do not. It would be simply silly to say of two men
with perhaps equal effective skill in drawing, one an untaught
natural genius, the other a mere obstinate plodder
in the studio, that both alike owe their skill to their 'experience.'
The reasons of their several skills lie in wholly
disparate natural cycles of causation.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p><i>I will then,</i> with the reader's permission, <i>restrict the
word 'experience' to processes which influence the mind by
the front-door-way of simple habits and association.</i> What
the back-door-effects may be will probably grow clearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
as we proceed; so I will pass right on to a scrutiny of the
actual mental structure which we find.</p>


<h4>THE GENESIS OF THE ELEMENTARY MENTAL CATEGORIES.</h4>


<p>We find: 1. Elementary sorts of sensation, and feelings
of personal activity;</p>

<p>2. Emotions; desires; instincts; ideas of worth; æsthetic
ideas;</p>

<p>3. Ideas of time and space and number;</p>

<p>4. Ideas of difference and resemblance, and of their degrees.</p>

<p>5. Ideas of causal dependence among events; of end
and means; of subject and attribute.</p>

<p>6. Judgments affirming, denying, doubting, supposing
any of the above ideas.</p>

<p>7. Judgments that the former judgments logically involve,
exclude, or are indifferent to, each other.</p>

<p>Now we may postulate at the outset that all these
forms of thought have a <i>natural</i> origin, if we could only get
at it. That assumption must be made at the outset of every
scientific investigation, or there is no temptation to proceed.
But the first account of their origin which we are
likely to hit upon is a snare. All these mental affections
are ways of knowing objects. Most psychologists nowadays
believe that the objects first, in some natural way, engendered
a brain from out of their midst, and then imprinted
these various cognitive affections upon it. But how? The
ordinary evolutionist answer to this question is exceedingly
simple-minded. The idea of most speculators seems to be
that, since it suffices <i>now</i> for us to become acquainted with
a complex object, that it should be simply <i>present</i> to us
often enough, so it must be fair to assume universally
that, with time enough given, the <i>mere presence</i> of the
various objects and relations to be known must end by
bringing about the latter's cognition, and that in this way
all mental structure was from first to last evolved. Any
ordinary Spencerite will tell you that just as the experience
of blue objects wrought into our mind the color blue, and
hard objects got it to feel hardness, so the presence of
large and small objects in the world gave it the notion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
size, moving objects made it aware of motion, and objective
successions taught it time. Similarly in a world with different
impressing things, the mind had to acquire a sense
of difference, whilst the like parts of the world as they fell
upon it kindled in it the perception of similarity. Outward
sequences which sometimes held good, and sometimes
failed, naturally engendered in it doubtful and uncertain
forms of expectation, and ultimately gave rise to the disjunctive
forms of judgment; whilst the hypothetic form,
'if <i>a</i>, then <i>b</i>,' was sure to ensue from sequences that were
invariable in the outer world. On this view, if the outer
order suddenly were to change its elements and modes, we
should have no faculties to cognize the new order by. At
most we should feel a sort of frustration and confusion.
But little by little the new presence would work on us as
the old one did; and in course of time another set of
psychic categories would arise, fitted to take cognizance of
the altered world.</p>

<p>This notion of the outer world inevitably building up a
sort of mental duplicate of itself if we only give it time, is
so easy and natural in its vagueness that one hardly knows
how to start to criticise it. One thing, however, is obvious,
namely that <i>the manner in which we now become acquainted
with complex objects need not in the least resemble the manner
in which the original elements of our consciousness grew up.</i>
Now, it is true, a new sort of animal need only be present
to me, to impress its image permanently on my mind; but
this is because I am already in possession of categories for
knowing each and all of its several attributes, and of a
memory for retracing the order of their conjunction. I
now have preformed categories for all possible objects.
The objects need only awaken these from their slumber.
But it is a very different matter to account for the categories
themselves. I think we must admit that the origin of the
various elementary feelings is a recondite history, even
after some sort of neural tissue is there for the outer world
to begin its work on. The mere existence of things to be
known is even now not, as a rule, sufficient to bring about
a knowledge of them. Our abstract and general discoveries
usually come to us as lucky fancies: and it is only <i>après coup</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
that we find that they correspond to some reality.
What immediately produced them were previous thoughts,
with which, and with the brain-processes of which, that
reality had naught to do.</p>

<p>Why may it not have been so of the original elements
of consciousness, sensation, time, space, resemblance,
difference, and other relations? Why may they not have
come into being by the back-door method, by such
physical processes as lie more in the sphere of morphological
accident, of inward summation of effects, than in
that of the 'sensible presence' of objects? Why may they
not, in short, be pure <i>idiosyncrasies</i>, spontaneous variations,
fitted by good luck (those of them which have survived)
to take cognizance of objects (that is, to steer us in our
active dealings with them), without being in any intelligible
sense immediate derivatives from them? I think we shall
find this view gain more and more plausibility as we proceed.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>All these elements are subjective duplicates of outer
objects. They <i>are</i> not the outer objects. The secondary
qualities among them are not supposed by any educated
person even to resemble the objects. Their <i>nature</i> depends
more on the reacting brain than on the stimuli which
touch it off. This is even more palpably true of the natures
of pleasure and pain, effort, desire and aversion, and of such
feelings as those of cause and substance, of denial and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
doubt. Here then is a native wealth of inner forms whose
origin is shrouded in mystery, and which at any rate were
not simply 'impressed' from without, in any intelligible
sense of the verb 'to impress.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Their <i>time- and space-relations</i>, however, <i>are</i> impressed
from without&mdash;for two outer things at least the evolutionary
psychologist must believe to resemble our thoughts of
them, these are the time and space in which the objects lie.
<i>The time- and space-relations between things do stamp copies
of themselves within.</i> Things juxtaposed in space impress us,
continue to be thought of <i>as</i> thus juxtaposed. Things sequent
in time impress their sequence on our memory. And
thus, through experience in the legitimate sense of the word
there can be truly explained an immense number of our
mental habitudes, many of our abstract beliefs, and all our
ideas of concrete things, and of their ways of behavior.
Such truths as that fire burns and water wets, that glass
refracts, heat melts snow, fishes live in water and die on
land, and the like, form no small part of the most refined
education, and are the all-in-all of education amongst the
brutes and lowest men. Here the mind is passive and
tributary, a servile copy, fatally and unresistingly fashioned
from without. It is the merit of the associationist school
to have seen the wide scope of these effects of neighborhood
in time and space; and their exaggerated applications
of the principle of mere neighborhood ought not to blind
us to the excellent service it has done to Psychology in
their hands. As far as a large part of our thinking goes,
then, it can intelligibly be formulated as a mere lot of <i>habits</i>
impressed upon us from without. The degree of cohesion
of our inner relations, is, in this part of our thinking, proportionate,
in Mr. Spencer's phrase, to the degree of cohesion
of the outer relations; the causes and the objects of
our thought are one; and we are, in so far forth, what the
materialistic evolutionists would have us altogether, mere
offshoots and creatures of our environment, and naught
besides.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span></p>
<p>But now the plot thickens, for the images impressed
upon our memory by the outer stimuli are not restricted to
the mere time- and space-relations, in which they originally
came, but revive in various manners (dependent on the intricacy
of the brain-paths and the instability of the tissue
thereof), and form secondary combinations such as the
<i>forms of judgment</i>, which, taken <i>per se</i>, are not congruent
either with the forms in which reality exists or in those in
which experiences befall us, but which may nevertheless
be explained by the way in which experiences befall in a
mind gifted with memory, expectation, and the possibility
of feeling doubt, curiosity, belief, and denial. The conjunctions
of experience befall more or less invariably, variably,
or never. The idea of one term will then engender a
fixed, a wavering, or a negative expectation of another, giving
affirmative, the hypothetical, disjunctive, interrogative,
and negative judgments, and judgments of actuality and
possibility about certain things. The separation of attribute
from subject in all judgments (which violates the way in
which nature exists) may be similarly explained by the
piecemeal order in which our perceptions come to us, a
vague nucleus growing gradually more detailed as we attend
to it more and more. These particular secondary mental
forms have had ample justice done them by associationists
from Hume downwards.</p>

<p>Associationists have also sought to account for discrimination,
abstraction, and generalization by the rates of frequency
in which attributes come to us conjoined. With
much less success, I think. In the chapter on Discrimination,
I have, under the "law of dissociation by varying concomitants,"
sought to explain as much as possible by the
passive order of experience. But the reader saw how much
was left for active interest and unknown forces to do. In
the chapter on Imagination I have similarly striven to do
justice to the 'blended image' theory of generalization and
abstraction. So I need say no more of these matters here.</p>


<h4>THE GENESIS OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES.</h4>


<p>Our 'scientific' ways of thinking the outer reality are
highly abstract ways. The essence of things for science is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
not to be what they seem, but to be atoms and molecules
moving to and from each other according to strange laws.
Nowhere does the account of inner relations produced by
outer ones in proportion to the frequency with which the
latter have been met, more egregiously break down than in
the case of scientific conceptions. The order of scientific
thought is quite incongruent either with the way in which
reality exists or with the way in which it comes before us.
Scientific thought goes by selection and emphasis exclusively.
We break the solid plenitude of fact into separate
essences, conceive generally what only exists particularly,
and by our classifications leave nothing in its natural
neighborhood, but separate the contiguous, and join what
the poles divorce. The reality <i>exists</i> as a <i>plenum</i>. All its
parts are contemporaneous, each is as real as any other, and
each as essential for making the whole just what it is and
nothing else. But we can neither experience nor think
this <i>plenum</i>. What we experience, what <i>comes before us</i>, is
a chaos of fragmentary impressions interrupting each
other;<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> what we <i>think</i> is an abstract system of hypothetical
data and laws.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span></p>
<p>This sort of scientific algebra, little as it immediately
resembles the reality given to us, turns out (strangely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
enough) applicable to it. That is, it yields expressions
which, at given places and times, can be translated into
real values, or interpreted as definite portions of the chaos
that falls upon our sense. It becomes thus a practical
guide to our expectations as well as a theoretic delight.
But I do not see how any one with a sense for the facts can
possibly call our systems immediate results of 'experience'
in the ordinary sense. Every scientific conception is in the
first instance a 'spontaneous variation' in some one's brain.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
For one that proves useful and applicable there are a thousand
that perish through their worthlessness. Their genesis
is strictly akin to that of the flashes of poetry and sallies
of wit to which the instable brain-paths equally give rise.
But whereas the poetry and wit (like the science of the
ancients) are their 'own excuse for being,' and have to run
the gauntlet of no farther test, the 'scientific' conceptions
must prove their worth by being 'verified.' This test, however,
is the cause of their <i>preservation</i>, not that of their production;
and one might as well account for the origin of
Artemus Ward's jokes by the 'cohesion' of subjects with
predicates in proportion to the 'persistence of the outer
relations' to which they 'correspond' as to treat the genesis
of scientific conceptions in the same ponderously unreal
way.</p>

<p>The most persistent outer relations which science believes
in are never matters of experience at all, but have to
be disengaged from under experience by a process of elimination,
that is, by ignoring conditions which are always
present. The <i>elementary</i> laws of mechanics, physics, and
chemistry are all of this sort. The principle of uniformity
in nature is of this sort; it has to be <i>sought</i> under and in
spite of the most rebellious appearances; and our conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
of its truth is far more like a religious faith than like
assent to a demonstration. The only cohesions which experience
in the literal sense of the word produces in our
mind are, as we contended some time back, the proximate
laws of nature, and habitudes of concrete things, that heat
melts ice, that salt preserves meat, that fish die out of
water, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> Such 'empirical truths' as these we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
admitted to form an enormous part of human wisdom. The
'scientific' truths have to harmonize with these truths, or
be given up as useless; but they arise in the mind in no
such passive associative way as that in which the simpler
truths arise. Even those experiences which are used to
prove a scientific truth are for the most part artificial experiences
of the laboratory gained after the truth itself has
been conjectured. Instead of experiences engendering the
'inner relations,' the inner relations are what engender the
experiences here.</p>

<p>What happens in the brain after experience has done its
utmost is what happens in every material mass which has
been fashioned by an outward force,&mdash;in every pudding or
mortar, for example, which I may make with my hands.
The fashioning from without brings the elements into collocations
which set new internal forces free to exert their
effects in turn. And the random irradiations and resettlements
of our ideas, which <i>supervene upon experience</i>, and
constitute our free mental play, are due entirely to these
secondary internal processes, which vary enormously from
brain to brain, even though the brains be exposed to
exactly the same 'outer relations.' The higher thought-processes
owe their being to causes which correspond far
more to the sourings and fermentations of dough, the setting
of mortar, or the subsidence of sediments in mixtures, than
to the manipulations by which these physical aggregates
came to be compounded. Our study of similar association
and reasoning taught us that the whole superiority of man
depended on the facility with which in his brain the paths
worn by the most frequent outer cohesions could be ruptured.
The causes of the instability, the reasons why now
this point and now that become in him the seat of rupture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
we saw to be entirely obscure. (Vol. I. p. 580; Vol. II. <a href="#Page_364">p.
364</a>.) The only clear thing about the peculiarity seems to
be its interstitial character, and the certainty that no mere
appeal to man's 'experience' suffices to explain it.</p>

<p>When we pass from scientific to æsthetic and ethical
systems, every one readily admits that, although the elements
are matters of experience, the peculiar forms of
relation into which they are woven are incongruent with
the order of passively received experience. The world of
æsthetics and ethics is an ideal world, a Utopia, a world
which the outer relations persist in contradicting, but which
we as stubbornly persist in striving to make actual. Why
do we thus invincibly crave to alter the given order of
nature? Simply because other relations among things are far
more interesting to us and more charming than the mere
rates of frequency of their time- and space-conjunctions.
These other relations are all secondary and brain-born,
'spontaneous variations' most of them, of our sensibility,
whereby certain elements of experience, and certain arrangements
in time and space, have acquired an agreeableness
which otherwise would not have been felt. It is true that
habitual arrangements may also become agreeable. But this
agreeableness of the merely habitual is felt to be a mere
ape and counterfeit of real inward fitness; and one sign of
intelligence is never to mistake the one for the other.</p>

<p><i>There are then ideal and inward relations amongst the objects
of our thought which can in no intelligible sense whatever
be interpreted as reproductions of the order of outer experience.</i>
In the æsthetic and ethical realms they conflict with
its order&mdash;the early Christian with his kingdom of heaven,
and the contemporary anarchist with his abstract dream of
justice, will tell you that the existing order must perish,
root and branch, ere the true order can come. Now the
peculiarity of those relations among the objects of our
thought which are dubbed 'scientific' is this, that although
they no more are inward <i>reproductions</i> of the outer order
than the ethical and æsthetic relations are, yet they do not
conflict with that order, but, once having sprung up by the
play of the inward forces, are found&mdash;some of them at least,
namely the only ones which have survived long enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
be matters of record&mdash;to be <i>congruent</i> with the time- and
space-relations which our impressions affect.</p>

<p>In other words, though nature's materials lend themselves
slowly and discouragingly to our translation of them
into ethical forms, but more readily into æsthetic forms;
to translation into scientific forms they lend themselves with
relative ease and completeness. The translation, it is true,
will probably never be ended. The perceptive order does
not give way, nor the right conceptive substitute for it arise,
at our bare word of command.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> It is often a deadly fight;
and many a man of science can say, like Johannes Müller,
after an investigation, '<i>Es klebt Blut an der Arbeit</i>.' But
victory after victory makes us sure that the essential doom
of our enemy is defeat.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE GENESIS OF THE PURE SCIENCES.</h4>


<p>I have now stated in general terms the relation of the
natural sciences to experience strictly so called, and shall
complete what I have to say by reverting to the subject on
a later page. At present I will pass to the so-called <i>pure</i>
or <i>a priori sciences</i> of Classification, Logic, and Mathematics.
My thesis concerning these is that they are even less than
the natural sciences effects of the order of the world as it
comes to our experience. <span class="smcap">The pure sciences express results
of comparison</span> <i>exclusively; comparison is not a conceivable
effect of the order in which outer impressions are experienced&mdash;it
is one of the house-born</i> (<a href="#Page_627">p. 627</a>) <i>portions of our mental
structure; therefore the pure sciences form a body of propositions
with whose genesis experience has nothing to do.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>First, consider the nature of comparison. <i>The relations
of resemblance and difference among things have nothing to
do with the time- and space-order in which we may experience
the latter.</i> Suppose a hundred beings created by God
and gifted with the faculties of memory and comparison.
Suppose that upon each of them the same lot of sensations
are imprinted, but in different orders. Let some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>
of them have no single sensation more than once. Let
some have this one and others that one repeated. Let
every conceivable permutation prevail. And then let the
magic-lantern show die out, and keep the creatures in a
void eternity, with naught but their memories to muse upon.
Inevitably in their long leisure they will begin to play with
the items of their experience and rearrange them, make
classificatory series of them, place gray between white and
black, orange between red and yellow, and trace all other
degrees of resemblance and difference. And this new construction
will be absolutely identical in all the hundred
creatures, the diversity of the sequence of the original experiences
having no effect as regards this rearrangement.
Any and every form of sequence will give the same result,
because the result expresses the relation between the <i>inward
natures</i> of the sensations; and to that the question of their
outward succession is quite irrelevant. Black will differ
from white just as much in a world in which they always
come close together as in one in which they always come
far apart; just as much in one in which they appear rarely
as in one in which they appear all the time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the advocate of 'persistent outer relations' may still
return to the charge: These <i>are</i> what make us so sure that
white and black differ, he may say; for in a world where
sometimes black resembled white and sometimes differed
from it, we could never be so sure. It is because in this
world black and white have <i>always</i> differed that the sense
of their difference has become a necessary form of thought.
The pair of colors on the one hand and the sense of difference
on the other, inseparably experienced, not only by ourselves
but by our ancestors, have become inseparably connected
in the mind. Not through any essential structure
of the mind, which made difference the only possible feeling
which they could arouse; no, but because they simply
<i>did</i> differ so often that at last they begat in us an impotency
to imagine them doing anything else, and made us accept
such a fabulous account as that just presented, of creatures
to whom a single experience would suffice to make us
feel the necessity of this relation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span></p>
<p>I know not whether Mr. Spencer would subscribe to
this or not;&mdash;nor do I care, for there are mysteries which
press more for solution than the meaning of this vague
writer's words. But to me such an explanation of our
difference-judgment is absolutely unintelligible. We now
find black and white different, the explanation says, <i>because
we have always have so found them.</i> But why should
we always have so found them? Why should difference
have popped into our heads so invariably with the thought
of them? There must have been either a subjective or an
objective reason. The subjective reason can only be that
our minds were so constructed that a sense of difference
was the only sort of conscious transition possible between
black and white; the objective reason can only be that
difference was always there, with these colors, outside the
mind as an objective fact. The subjective reason explains
outer frequency by inward structure, not inward structure
by outer frequency; and so surrenders the experience-theory.
The objective reason simply says that if an outer
difference is there the mind must needs know it&mdash;which is
no explanation at all, but a mere appeal to the fact that
somehow the mind does know what is there.</p>

<p>The only clear thing to do is to give up the sham of a
pretended explanation, and to fall back on the fact that
the sense of difference <i>has</i> arisen, in some natural manner
doubtless, but in a manner which we do not understand.
It was by the back-stairs way, at all events; and, from the
very first, happened to be the only mode of reaction by
which consciousness could feel the transition from one term
to another of what (in <i>consequence</i> of this very reaction) we
now call a contrasted pair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In noticing the differences and resemblances of things,
and their degrees, the mind feels its own activity, and has
given the name of <i>comparison</i> thereto. It need not compare
its materials, but if once roused to do so, it can compare
them with but one result, and this a fixed consequence of
the nature of the materials themselves. Difference and resemblance
are thus relations between ideal objects, or conceptions
as such. To learn whether black and white differ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>
I need not consult the world of experience at all; the mere
ideas suffice. <i>What I mean</i> by black differs from <i>what I
mean</i> by white, whether such colors exist <i>extra mentem meam</i>
or not. If they ever do so exist, they <i>will</i> differ. White
things may blacken, but the black of them will differ from
the white of them, so long as I mean anything definite by
these three words.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>I shall now in what follows call all propositions which express
time- and space-relations empirical propositions; and I
shall give the name of rational propositions to all propositions
which express the results of a comparison.</i> The latter denomination
is in a sense arbitrary, for resemblance and difference
are not usually held to be the only rational relations
between things. I will next proceed to show, however,
how many other rational relations commonly supposed distinct
can be resolved into these, so that my definition of
rational propositions will end, I trust, by proving less arbitrary
than it now appears to be.</p>


<h4>SERIES OF EVEN DIFFERENCE AND MEDIATE COMPARISON.</h4>


<p>In Chapter XII we saw that the mind can at successive
moments <i>mean the same</i>, and that it gradually comes into
possession of a stock of permanent and fixed meanings,
ideal objects, or conceptions, some of which are universal
qualities, like the black and white of our example, and some,
individual things. We now see that not only are the objects
permanent mental possessions, but the results of their comparison
are permanent too. The objects and their differences
together form an immutable system. <i>The same objects,
compared in the same way, always give the same results;</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
if the result be not the same, then the objects are not those
originally meant.</p>

<p>This last principle, which we may call the <i>axiom of constant
result</i>, holds good throughout all our mental operations,
not only when we compare, but when we add, divide,
class, or infer a given matter in any conceivable way.
Its most general expression would be "<i>the Same operated
on in the same way gives the Same</i>." In mathematics it
takes the form of "equals added to, or subtracted from,
equals give equals," and the like. We shall meet with it
again.</p>

<p>The next thing which we observe is that <i>the operation
of comparing may be repeated on its own results</i>; in other
words, that we can think of the various resemblances and
differences which we find and compare them with each
other, making differences and resemblances of a higher
order. <i>The mind thus becomes aware of sets of similar differences,
and forms series of terms with the same kind and amount
of difference between them, terms which, as they succeed each
other, maintain a constant direction of serial increase.</i> This
sense of constant direction in a series of operations we saw
in Chapter XIII (p. 490) to be a cardinal mental fact.
"A differs from B differs from C differs from D, etc.,"
makes a <i>series</i> only when the differences are in the same
direction. In any such difference-series all terms differ
in just the same way from their predecessors. The numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,... the notes of the chromatic scale in
music, are familiar examples. As soon as the mind grasps
such a series as a whole, it perceives that <i>two terms taken
far apart differ more than two terms taken near together</i>,
and that any one term differs more from a remote than
from a near successor, and this no matter what the terms
may be, or what the sort of difference may be, provided it
is always the same sort.</p>

<p>This <span class="smcap">principle of mediate comparison</span> might be briefly
(though obscurely) expressed by the formula "<i>more than
the more is more than the less</i>"&mdash;the words <i>more</i> and <i>less</i>
standing simply for degrees of increase along a constant
direction of differences. Such a formula would cover all
possible cases, as, earlier than early is earlier than late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
worse than bad is worse than good, east of east is east of
west; etc., etc., <i>ad libitum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Symbolically, we might write
it as <i>a</i> &lt; <i>b</i> &lt; <i>c</i> &lt; <i>d</i>.... and say that any number of
intermediaries may be expunged without obliging us to
alter anything in what remains written.</p>

<p>The principle of mediate comparison is only one form
of a law which holds in many series of homogeneously
related terms, the law that <i>skipping intermediary terms
leaves relations the same</i>. This <span class="smcap">axiom of skipped intermediaries</span>
or of <span class="smcap">transferred relations</span> occurs, as we soon shall
see, in logic as the fundamental principle of inference, in
arithmetic as the fundamental property of the number-series,
in geometry as that of the straight line, the plane
and the parallel. <i>It seems to be on the whole the broadest and
deepest law of man's thought.</i></p>

<p>In certain lists of terms the result of comparison may
be to find no-difference, or equality in place of difference.
Here also intermediaries may be skipped, and mediate comparison
be carried on with the general result expressed by
the <i>axiom of mediate equality</i>, "equals of equals are equal,"
which is the great principle of the mathematical sciences.
This too as a result of the mind's mere acuteness, and in
utter independence of the order in which experiences come
associated together. Symbolically, again: <i>a = b = c = d...,</i>
with the same consequence as regards expunging terms
which we saw before.</p>


<h4>CLASSIFICATORY SERIES.</h4>


<p>Thus we have a rather intricate system of necessary and
immutable <i>ideal truths of comparison</i>, a system applicable to
terms <i>experienced</i> in any order of sequence or frequency, or
even to terms never experienced or to be experienced, such
as the mind's imaginary constructions would be. These
truths of comparison result in <i>Classifications</i>. It is, for some
unknown reason, a great æsthetic delight for the mind to
break the order of experience, and class its materials in serial
orders, proceeding from step to step of difference, and to
contemplate untiringly the crossings and inosculations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
series among themselves. The first steps in most of the
sciences are purely classificatory. Where facts fall easily
into rich and intricate series (as plants and animals and
chemical compounds do), the mere sight of the series fills
the mind with a satisfaction <i>sui generis</i>; and a world whose
<i>real</i> materials naturally lend themselves to serial classification
is <i>pro tanto</i> a more rational world, a world with
which the mind will feel more intimate, than with a world
in which they do not. By the pre-evolutionary naturalists,
whose generation has hardly passed away, classifications
were supposed to be ultimate insights into God's mind,
filling us with adoration of his ways. The fact that
Nature lets us make them was a proof of the presence of
his Thought in her bosom. So far as the facts of experience
can <i>not</i> be serially classified, therefore, so far experience
fails to be rational in <i>one</i> of the ways, at least,
which we crave.</p>


<h4>THE LOGIC-SERIES.</h4>


<p>Closely akin to the function of comparison is that of
<i>judging, predicating, or subsuming</i>. In fact, these elementary
intellectual functions run into each other so, that it
is often only a question of practical convenience whether
we shall call a given mental operation by the name of
one or of the other. Comparisons result in groups
of like things; and presently (through discrimination and
abstraction) in conceptions of the <i>respects</i> in which the
likenesses obtain. The groups are <i>genera</i> or <i>classes</i>, the
respects are <i>characters</i> or <i>attributes</i>. The attributes again
may be compared, forming genera of higher orders, and
their characters singled out; so that we have a new sort
of series, <i>that of predication, or of kind including kind</i>. Thus
horses are quadrupeds, quadrupeds animals, animals
machines, machines liable to wear out, etc. In such a
series as this the several couplings of terms may have
been made out originally at widely different times and
under different circumstances. But memory may bring
them together afterwards; and whenever it does so, our
faculty of apprehending serial increase makes us conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span>
of them as a single system of successive terms united by
the same relation.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>Now whenever we become thus conscious, we may become
aware of an additional relation which is of the highest
intellectual importance, inasmuch as upon it the whole
structure of logic is reared. <i>The principle of mediate predication
or subsumption</i> is only the axiom of skipped intermediaries
applied to a series of successive predications. It
expresses the fact that any earlier term in the series stands
to any later term in the same relation in which it stands
to any intermediate term; in other words, that <i>whatever
has an attribute has all the attributes of that attribute;</i> or more
briefly still, that <i>whatever is of a kind is of that kind's kind.</i>
A little explanation of this statement will bring out all
that it involves.</p>

<p>We learned in the chapter on Reasoning what our
great motive is for abstracting attributes and predicating
them. It is that our varying practical purposes require
us to lay hold of different angles of the reality at different
times. But for these we should be satisfied to 'see it
whole,' and always alike. The purpose, however, makes
one aspect essential; so, to avoid dispersion of the attention,
we treat the reality as if for the time being it were
nothing but that aspect, and we let its supernumerary determinations
go. In short, we substitute the aspect for
the whole real thing. <i>For our purpose</i> the aspect <i>can</i> be
substituted for the whole, and the two treated as the same;
and the word <i>is</i> (which couples the whole with its aspect
or attribute in the categoric judgment) expresses (among
other things) the identifying operation performed. The
predication-series <i>a</i> is <i>b, b</i> is <i>c, c</i> is <i>d</i>,... closely resembles
for certain practical purposes the equation-series <i>a = b,
b = c, c = d</i>, etc.</p>

<p>But what is our purpose in predicating? Ultimately,
it may be anything we please; but proximately and immediately,
it is always the gratification of a certain curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>
as to whether the object in hand is or is not <i>of a kind</i>
connected with that ultimate purpose. Usually the connection
is not obvious, and we only find that the object S
is of a kind connected with P, after first finding that it is
of a kind M, which itself is connected with P. Thus, to
fix our ideas by an example, we have a curiosity (our ultimate
purpose being conquest over nature) as to how Sirius
may move. It is not obvious whether Sirius is a kind of
thing which moves in the line of sight or not. When,
however, we find it to be a kind of thing in whose spectrum
the hydrogen-line is shifted, and when we reflect that <i>that</i>
kind of thing is a kind of thing which moves in the line
of sight; we conclude that Sirius does so move. Whatever
Sirius's attribute is, Sirius is; its adjective's adjective can
supersede its own adjective in our thinking, and this with
no loss to our knowledge, <i>so long as we stick to the definite
purpose in view.</i></p>

<p>Now please note that this elimination of intermediary
kinds and transfer of <i>is</i>'s along the line, results from our
insight into the very meaning of the word <i>is</i>, and into the
constitution of any series of terms connected by that relation.
It has naught to do with what any particular thing is
or is not; but, <i>whatever</i> any given thing may be, we see
that it also is whatever <i>that</i> is, indefinitely. To grasp in
one view a succession of <i>is</i>'s is to apprehend this relation
between the terms which they connect; just as to grasp a
list of successive equals is to apprehend their <i>mutual</i> equality
throughout. The principle of mediate subsumption
thus expresses relations of ideal objects as such. It can be
discovered by a mind left at leisure with any set of meanings
(however originally obtained), of which some are predicable
of others. The moment we string them in a serial
line, that moment we see that we can drop intermediaries,
treat remote terms just like near ones, and put a genus in
the place of a species. This shows that <i>the principle of
mediate subsumption has nothing to do with the particular
order of our experiences, or with the outer coexistences and
sequences of terms.</i> Were it a mere outgrowth of habit
and association, we should be forced to regard it as having
no universal validity; for every hour of the day we meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>
things which we consider to be of this kind or of that, but
later learn that they have none of the kind's properties, that
they <i>do not</i> belong to the kind's kind. Instead, however, of
correcting the principle by these cases, we correct the cases
by the principle. We say that if the thing we named an M
has not M's properties, then we were either mistaken in calling
it an M, or mistaken about M's properties; or else that it
is no longer M, but has changed. But we never say that it
is an M without M's properties; for by conceiving a thing as
of the kind M I mean that it <i>shall</i> have M's properties, be of
M's kind, even though I should never be able to find in the
real world anything which is an M. The principle emanates
from my perception of what a lot of successive is's <i>mean</i>.
This perception can no more be confirmed by one set, or
weakened by another set, of outer facts, than the perception
that black is not white can be confirmed by the fact that
snow never blackens, or weakened by the fact that photographer's
paper blackens as soon as you lay it in the sun.</p>

<p>The abstract scheme of successive predications, extended
indefinitely, with all the possibilities of substitution which
it involves, is thus an immutable system of truth which
flows from the very structure and form of our thinking.
<i>If</i> any real terms ever do fit into such a scheme, they
will obey its laws; <i>whether</i> they do is a question as to
nature's facts, the answer to which can only be empirically
ascertained. <i>Formal logic</i> is the name of the Science
which traces in skeleton form all the remote relations
of terms connected by successive <i>is</i>'s with each other,
and enumerates their possibilities of mutual substitution.
To our principle of mediate subsumption she has given
various formulations, of which the best is perhaps this
broad expression, that <i>the same can be substituted for the same
in any mental operation.</i><a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>The ordinary logical series contains but three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>
terms&mdash;"Socrates, man, mortal." But we also have 'Sorites'&mdash;Socrates,
man, animal, machine, run down, mortal, etc.&mdash;and
it violates psychology to represent these as syllogisms
with terms suppressed. The ground of there being any
logic at all is our power to grasp any series as a whole,
and the more terms it holds the better. This synthetic
consciousness of an uniform direction of advance through
a multiplicity of terms is, apparently, what the brutes and
lower men cannot accomplish, and what gives to us our
extraordinary power of ratiocinative thought. The mind
which can grasp a string of <i>is</i>'s as a whole&mdash;the objects
linked by them may be ideal or real, physical, mental, or
symbolic, indifferently&mdash;can also apply to it the principle
of skipped intermediaries. <i>The logic-list is thus in its origin
and essential nature just like those graded classificatory lists
which we erewhile described.</i> The 'rational proposition' which
lies at the basis of all reasoning, the <i>dictum de omni et nullo</i>
in all the various forms in which it may be expressed,
the fundamental law of thought, is thus <i>only the result of
the function of comparison</i> in a mind which has come by
some lucky variation to apprehend a series of more than
two terms at once.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> So far, then, <i>both Systematic Classification
and Logic are seen to be incidental results of the mere
capacity for discerning difference and likeness,</i> which capacity
is a thing with which the <i>order of experience</i>, properly so
styled, has absolutely nothing to do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But how comes it (it may next be asked) when systematic
classifications have so little ultimate theoretic importance&mdash;for
the conceiving of things according to their
mere degrees of resemblance always yields to other modes
of conceiving when these can be obtained&mdash;that the logical
relations among things should form such a mighty engine
for dealing with the facts of life?</p>

<p>Chapter XXII already gave the reason (see <a href="#Page_335">p. 335</a>,
above). This world <i>might</i> be a world in which all things
differed, and in which what properties there were were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span>
ultimate and had no farther predicates. In such a world
there would be as many kinds as there were separate things.
We could never subsume a new thing under an old kind;
or if we could, no consequences would follow. Or, again,
this might be a world in which innumerable things were
of a kind, but in which no concrete thing remained of the
same kind long, but all objects were in a flux. Here again,
though we could subsume and infer, our logic would be of
no practical use to us, for the subjects of our propositions
would have changed whilst we were talking. In such worlds,
logical relations would obtain, and be known (doubtless) as
they are now, but they would form a merely theoretic
scheme and be of no use for the conduct of life. But our
world is no such world. It is a very peculiar world, and
plays right into logic's hands. <i>Some</i> of the things, at least,
which it contains are of the same kind as other things; <i>some</i>
of them remain always of the kind of which they once were;
and some of the properties of them cohere indissolubly and
are always found together. <i>Which</i> things these latter things
are we learn by experience in the strict sense of the word,
and the results of the experience are embodied in 'empirical
propositions.' Whenever such a thing is met with by us
now, our sagacity notes it to be of a certain kind; our
learning immediately recalls that kind's kind, and then <i>that</i>
kind's kind, and so on; so that a moment's thinking may
make us aware that the thing is of a kind so remote that
we could never have directly perceived the connection.
The flight to this last kind <i>over the heads of the intermediaries</i>
is the essential feature of the intellectual operation here.
Evidently it is a pure outcome of our sense for apprehending
serial increase; and, unlike the several propositions
themselves which make up the series (and which may all
be empirical), it has nothing to do with the time- and space-order
in which the things have been experienced.</p>


<h4>MATHEMATICAL RELATIONS.</h4>


<p>So much for the <i>a priori</i> necessities called systematic
classification and logical inference. The other couplings
of data which pass for <i>a priori</i> necessities of thought are
the <i>mathematical</i> judgments, and certain metaphysical propositions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span>
These latter we shall consider farther on. As
regards the mathematical judgments, they are all 'rational
propositions' in the sense defined on <a href="#Page_644">p. 644</a>, for they express
results of comparison and nothing more. The mathematical
sciences deal with similarities and equalities exclusively,
and not with coexistences and sequences. Hence they have,
in the first instance, no connection with the order of experience.
The comparisons of mathematics are between
numbers and extensive magnitudes, giving rise to arithmetic
and geometry respectively.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Number</i> seems to signify primarily the strokes of our
attention in discriminating things. These strokes remain
in the memory in groups, large or small, and the groups can
be compared. The discrimination is, as we know, psychologically
facilitated by the mobility of the thing as a total
(<a href="#Page_173">p. 173</a>). But within each thing we discriminate parts; so
that the number of things which any one given phenomenon
may be depends in the last instance on our way of
taking it. A globe is one, if undivided; two, if composed
of hemispheres. A sand-heap is one thing, or twenty
thousand things, as we may choose to count it. We amuse
ourselves by the counting of <i>mere</i> strokes, to form rhythms,
and these we compare and name. Little by little in our
minds the number-series is formed. This, like all lists of
terms in which there is a direction of serial increase, carries
with it the sense of those mediate relations between its
terms which we expressed by the axiom "the more than the
more is more than the less." That axiom seems, in fact,
only a way of stating that the terms do form an increasing
series. But, in addition to this, we are aware of certain
other relations among our strokes of counting. We may
interrupt them where we like, and go on again. All the
while we feel that the interruption does not alter the strokes
themselves. We may count 12 straight through; or count
7 and pause, and then count 5, but still the strokes will be
the same. We thus distinguish between our acts of counting
and those of interrupting or grouping, as between an
unchanged matter and an operation of mere shuffling performed
on it. The matter is the original units or strokes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
which all modes of grouping or combining simply give
us back unchanged. In short, <i>combinations of numbers
are combinations of their units</i>, which is the fundamental
axiom of arithmetic,<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> leading to such consequences as that
7 + 5 = 8 + 4 because both = 12. The general axiom of
mediate equality, that equals of equals are equal, comes in
here.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> The principle of constancy in our meanings, when
applied to strokes of counting, also gives rise to the axiom
that the same number, operated on (interrupted, grouped)
in the same way will always give the same result or be the
same. How shouldn't it? Nothing is supposed changed.</p>

<p><i>Arithmetic and its fundamental principles are thus independent
of our experiences or of the order of the world.</i>
The matter of arithmetic is <i>mental matter</i>; its principles flow
from the fact that the matter forms a series, which can be cut
into by us wherever we like without the matter changing.
The empiricist school has strangely tried to interpret the
truths of number as results of coexistences among outward
things. John Mill calls number a physical property
of things. 'One,' according to Mill, means one sort of
passive sensation which we receive, 'two' another, 'three'
a third. The same things, however, can give us different
number-sensations. Three things arranged thus, ---, for
example, impress us differently from three things arranged
thus, -_-. But experience tells us that every real object-group
which can be arranged in one of these ways can always be
arranged in the other also, and that 2 + 1 and 3 are thus
modes of numbering things which 'coexist' invariably with
each other. The indefeasibility of our belief in their 'coexistence'
(which is Mill's word for their equivalence) is
due solely to the enormous amount of experience we have
of it. For all things, whatever other sensations they may
give us, give us at any rate number-sensations. Those
number-sensations which the same thing may be successively
made to arouse are the numbers which we deem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>
equal to each other; those which the same thing refuses to
arouse are those which we deem unequal.</p>

<p>This is as clear a restatement as I can make of Mill's
doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> And its failure is written upon its front. Woe to
arithmetic, were such the only grounds for its validity!
The same real things are countable in numberless ways,
and pass from one numerical form, not only to its equivalent
(as Mill implies), but to its other, as the sport of
physical accidents or of our mode of attending may decide.
How could our notion that one and one are eternally
and necessarily two ever maintain itself in a world where
every time we add one drop of water to another we get not
two but one again? in a world where every time we add a
drop to a crumb of quicklime we get a dozen or more?&mdash;had
it no better warrant than such experiences? At most
we could then say that one and one are <i>usually</i> two.
Our arithmetical propositions would never have the confident
tone which they now possess. That confident
tone is due to the fact that they deal with abstract and ideal
numbers exclusively. <i>What we mean</i> by one plus one
<i>is</i> two; we <i>make</i> two out of it; and it would mean two
still even in a world where <i>physically</i> (according to a
conceit of Mill's) a third thing was engendered every time
one thing came together with another. We are masters
of our meanings, and discriminate between the things
we mean and our ways of taking them, between our strokes
of numeration themselves, and our bundlings and separatings
thereof.</p>

<p>Mill ought not only to have said, "All things are numbered."
He ought, in order to prove his point, to have
shown that they are <i>unequivocally</i> numbered, which they notoriously
are not. Only the abstract numbers themselves are
unequivocal, only those which we create mentally and hold
fast to as ideal objects always the same. A concrete natural
thing can always be numbered in a great variety of ways.
"We need only conceive a thing divided into four equal
parts (and all things may be conceived as so divided)," as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>
Mill is himself compelled to say, to find the number four
in it, and so on.</p>

<p>The relation of numbers to experience is just like that
of 'kinds' in logic. So long as an experience will keep its
kind we can handle it by logic. So long as it will keep its
number we can deal with it by arithmetic. <i>Sensibly</i>, however,
things are constantly changing their numbers, just as
they are changing their kinds. They are forever breaking
apart and fusing. Compounds and their elements are never
numerically identical, for the elements are sensibly many
and the compounds sensibly one. Unless our arithmetic
is to remain without application to life, we must somehow
<i>make</i> more numerical continuity than we spontaneously find.
Accordingly Lavoisier discovers his weight-units which remain
the same in compounds and elements, though volume-units
and quality-units all have changed. A great discovery!
And modern science outdoes it by denying that compounds
exist at all. There is no such thing as 'water' for
'science;' that is only a handy name for H<sub>2</sub> and O when
they have got into the position H-O-H, and then affect
our senses in a novel way. The modern theories of atoms,
of heat, and of gases are, in fact, only intensely artificial
devices for gaining that constancy in the numbers of
things which sensible experience will not show. "Sensible
things are not the things for me," says Science, "because
in their changes they will not keep their numbers the same.
Sensible qualities are not the qualities for me, because they
can with difficulty be numbered at all. These hypothetic
atoms, however, are the things, these hypothetic masses
and velocities are the qualities for me; they will stay numbered
all the time."</p>

<p>By such elaborate inventions, and at such a cost to the
imagination, do men succeed in making for themselves a
world in which real things shall be coerced <i>per fas aut
nefas</i> under arithmetical law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The other branch of mathematics is <i>geometry</i>. Its objects
are also ideal creations. Whether nature contain
circles or not, I can know what I mean by a circle and
can stick to my meaning; and when I mean two circles I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span>
mean two things of an identical kind. The axiom of constant
results (see above, <a href="#Page_645">p. 645</a>) holds in geometry. The
same forms, treated in the same way (added, subtracted,
or compared), give the same results&mdash;how shouldn't they?
The axioms of mediate comparison (<a href="#Page_645">p. 645</a>), of logic (<a href="#Page_648">p. 648</a>),
and of number (<a href="#Page_654">p. 654</a>) all apply to the forms which we
imagine in space, inasmuch as these resemble or differ
from each other, form kinds, and are numerable things.
But in addition to these general principles, which are true
of space-forms only as they are of other mental conceptions,
there are certain axioms relative to space-forms exclusively,
which we must briefly consider.</p>

<p>Three of them give marks of identity among straight
lines, planes, and parallels. Straight lines which have two
points, planes which have three points, parallels to a given
line which have one point, in common, coalesce throughout.
Some say that the certainty of our belief in these axioms
is due to repeated experiences of their truth; others that
it is due to an intuitive acquaintance with the properties
of space. It is neither. We experience lines enough which
pass through two points only to separate again, only we
won't call them straight. Similarly of planes and parallels.
We have a definite idea of what we mean by each of these
words; and when something different is offered us, we see
the difference. Straight lines, planes, and parallels, as they
figure in geometry, are mere inventions of our faculty for
apprehending serial increase. The farther continuations
of these forms, we say, <i>shall</i> bear the same relation to their
last visible parts which these did to still earlier parts. It
thus follows (from that axiom of skipped intermediaries
which obtains in all regular series) that parts of these
figures separated by other parts must agree in direction,
just as contiguous parts do. This uniformity of direction
throughout is, in fact, all that makes us care for these
forms, gives them their beauty, and stamps them into fixed
conceptions in our mind. But obviously if two lines, or
two planes, with a common segment, were to part company
beyond the segment, it could only be because the direction
of at least one of them had changed. Parting company in
lines and planes <i>means</i> changing direction, means assuming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
a new relation to the parts that pre-exist; and assuming a
new relation means ceasing to be straight or plane. If we
mean by a parallel a line that will never meet a second
line; and if we have one such line drawn through a point,
any new line drawn through that point which does not
coalesce with the first must be inclined to it, and if inclined
to it must approach the second, i.e., cease to be parallel
with it. No properties of outlying space need come in
here: only a definite conception of uniform direction, and
constancy in sticking to one's point.</p>

<p>The other two axioms peculiar to geometry are that
figures can be moved in space without change, and that no
variation in the way of subdividing a given amount of space
alters its total quantity.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> This last axiom is similar to
what we found to obtain in numbers. 'The whole is equal
to its parts' is an abridged way of expressing it. A man is
not the same biological whole if we cut him in two at the
neck as if we divide him at the ankles; but geometrically
he is the same whole, no matter in which place we cut him.
The axiom about figures being movable in space is rather
a postulate than an axiom. <i>So far as they are</i> so movable,
then certain fixed equalities and differences obtain between
forms, <i>no matter where placed</i>. But if translation through
space warped or magnified forms, then the relations of
equality, etc., would always have to be expressed with a
position-qualification added. A geometry as absolutely
certain as ours could be invented on the supposition of
such a space, if the laws of its warping and deformation
were fixed. It would, however, be much more complicated
than our geometry, which makes the simplest possible supposition;
and finds, luckily enough, that it is a supposition
with which the space of our experience seems to agree.</p>

<p>By means of these principles, all playing into each
other's hands, the mutual equivalences of an immense number
of forms can be traced, even of such as at first sight
bear hardly any resemblance to each other. We move and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>
turn them mentally, and find that parts of them will superpose.
We add imaginary lines which subdivide or enlarge
them, and find that the new figures resemble each other in
ways which show us that the old ones are equivalent too.
We thus end by expressing all sorts of forms in terms of
other forms, enlarging our knowledge of the kinds of things
which certain other kinds of things are, or to which they
are equivalent.</p>

<p>The result is a new system of mental objects which can
be treated as identical for certain purposes, a new series of
<i>is</i>'s almost indefinitely prolonged, just like the series of
equivalencies among numbers, part of which the multiplication-table
expresses. And all this is in the first instance
regardless of the coexistences and sequences of nature,
and regardless of whether the figures we speak of have ever
been outwardly experienced or not.</p>


<h4>CONSCIOUSNESS OF SERIES IS THE BASIS OF RATIONALITY.</h4>


<p>Classification, logic, and mathematics all result, then,
from the mere play of the mind comparing its conceptions,
no matter whence the latter may have come. The essential
condition for the formation of all these sciences is that we
should have grown capable of apprehending series as such,
and of distinguishing them as homogeneous or heterogeneous,
and as possessing definite directions of what I have
called 'increase.' This consciousness of series is a human
perfection which has been gradually evolved, and which
varies greatly from man to man. There is no accounting
for it as a result of habitual associations among outward
impressions, so we must simply ascribe it to the factors,
whatever they be, of inward cerebral growth. Once this
consciousness attained to, however, <i>mediate</i> thought becomes
possible; with our very awareness of a series may
go an awareness that dropping terms out of it will leave
identical relations between the terms that remain; and
thus arises a perception of relations between things so
naturally separate that we should otherwise never have
compared them together at all.</p>

<p>The axiom of skipped intermediaries applies, however,
only to certain particular series, and among them to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>
which we have considered, in which the recurring relation
is either of difference, of likeness, of kind, of numerical addition,
or of prolongation in the same linear or plane direction.
It is therefore not a purely formal law of thinking,
but flows from the nature of the matters thought about. It
will not do to say universally that in all series of homogeneously
related terms the remote members are related to
each other as the near ones are; for that will often be
untrue. The series A is not B is not C is not D.... does
not permit the relation to be traced between remote terms.
From two negations no inference can be drawn. Nor, to
become more concrete, does the lover of a woman generally
love her beloved, or the contradictor of a contradictor contradict
whomever he contradicts. The slayer of a slayer
does not slay the latter's victim; the acquaintances or enemies
of a man need not be each other's acquaintances or
enemies; nor are two things which are on top of a third
thing necessarily on top of each other.</p>

<p>All skipping of intermediaries and transfer of relations
occurs within homogeneous series. But not all homogeneous
series allow of intermediaries being skipped and relations
transferred. It depends on which series they are,
on what relations they contain.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> Let it not be said that it
is a mere matter of verbal association, due to the fact that
language sometimes permits us to transfer the <i>name</i> of a
relation over skipped intermediaries, and sometimes does
not; as where we call men 'progenitors' of their remote as
well as of their immediate posterity, but refuse to call them
'fathers' thereof. There are relations which are <i>intrinsically</i>
transferable, whilst others are not. The relation of
<i>condition</i>, e.g., is intrinsically transferable. What conditions
a condition conditions what it conditions&mdash;"cause of cause
is cause of effect." The relations of negation and <i>frustration,</i>
on the other hand, are not transferable: what frustrates a
frustration does not frustrate what it frustrates. No
changes of terminology would annul the intimate difference
between these two cases.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span></p>
<p>Nothing but the clear sight of the ideas themselves
shows whether the axiom of skipped intermediaries applies
to them or not. Their connections, immediate and remote,
flow from their inward natures. We try to consider them
in certain ways, to bring them into certain relations, and
we find that sometimes we can and sometimes we cannot
<i>The question whether there are or are not inward and essential
connections between conceived objects as such, really is the same
thing as the question whether we can get any new perception
from mentally coupling them together, or pass from one to
another by a mental operation which gives a result.</i> In the
case of some ideas and operations we get a result; but no
result in the case of others. Where a result comes, it is
due exclusively to the <i>nature</i> of the ideas and of the operation.
Take blueness and yellowness, for example. We can
operate on them in some ways, but not in other ways. We
can compare them; but we cannot add one to or subtract
it from the other. We can refer them to a common kind,
color; but we cannot make one a kind of the other, or infer
one from the other. This has nothing to do with experience.
For we <i>can</i> add blue <i>pigment</i> to yellow <i>pigment</i>, and subtract
it again, and get a result both times. Only we know
perfectly that this is no addition or subtraction of the blue
and yellow qualities or natures themselves.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is thus no denying the fact that <i>the mind is filled
with necessary and eternal relations which it finds between certain
of its ideal conceptions, and which form a determinate
system, independent of the order of frequency in which experience
may have associated the conception's originals in time and space.</i></p>

<p>Shall we continue to call these sciences 'intuitive,' innate,'
or '<i>a priori</i>' bodies of truth, or not?<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>
I should like to do so. But I hesitate to use the terms,
on account of the odium which controversial history has
made the whole of their connotation for many worthy persons.
The most politic way not to alienate these readers
is to flourish the name of the immortal Locke. For in truth
I have done nothing more in the previous pages than to
make a little more explicit the teachings of Locke's fourth
book:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The immutability of the same relations between the same immutable
things is now the idea that shows him that if the three angles of
a triangle were once equal to two right angles, they will always be
equal to two right ones. And hence he comes to be certain that what
was once true in the case is always true; what ideas once agreed will
always agree.... Upon this ground it is that particular demonstrations
in mathematics afford general knowledge. If, then, the perception
that the same ideas will eternally have the same habitudes and relations
be not a sufficient ground of knowledge, there could be no knowledge
of general propositions in mathematics.... All general knowledge
lies only in our own thoughts, and consists barely in the contemplation of
our abstract ideas. Wherever we perceive any agreement or disagreement
amongst them, there we have general knowledge; and by putting
the names of those ideas together accordingly in propositions, can with
certainty pronounce general truths.... What is once known of such
ideas will be perpetually and forever true. So that, as to all general
knowledge, we must search and find it only in our own minds and it is
only the examining of our own ideas that furnisheth us with that.
Truths belonging to essences of things (that is, to abstract ideas) are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span>
eternal, and are to be found out only by the contemplation of those
essences.... Knowledge is the consequence of the ideas (be they what
they will) that are in our minds, producing there certain general propositions....
Such propositions are therefore called 'eternal truths,'...
because, being once made about abstract ideas so as to be true, they
will, whenever they can be supposed to be made again, at any time past
or to come, by a mind having those ideas, always actually be true. For
names being supposed to stand perpetually for the same ideas, and the
same ideas having immutably the same habitudes one to another, propositions
concerning any abstract ideas that are once true must needs
be eternal verities."</p></blockquote>

<p>But what are these eternal verities, these 'agreements,'
which the mind discovers by barely considering its own
fixed meanings, except what I have said?&mdash;relations of likeness
and difference, immediate or mediate, between the
terms of certain series. Classification is serial comparison,
logic mediate subsumption, arithmetic mediate equality of
different bundles of attention-strokes, geometry mediate
equality of different ways of carving space. None of these
eternal verities has anything to say about facts, about what
is or is not in the world. Logic does not say whether Socrates,
men, mortals or immortals <i>exist</i>; arithmetic does
not tell us where her 7's, 5's, and 12's are to be <i>found</i>; geometry
affirms not that circles and rectangles are <i>real</i>. All
that these sciences make us sure of is, that <i>if</i> these things
are anywhere to be found, the eternal verities will obtain
of them. Locke accordingly never tires of telling us that the</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"universal propositions of whose truth or falsehood we can have certain
knowledge, concern not existence.... These universal and self-evident
principles, being only our constant, clear, and distinct knowledge
of our own ideas more general or comprehensive, can assure us of
nothing that passes without the mind; their certainty is founded only
upon the knowledge of each idea by itself, and of its distinction from
others; about which we cannot be mistaken whilst they are in our
minds.... The mathematician considers the truth and properties
belonging to a rectangle or circle only as they are in idea in his own
mind. For it is possible he never found either of them existing mathematically,
i.e., precisely true, in his life. But yet the knowledge he
has of any truths or properties belonging to a circle, or any other mathematical
figure, are nevertheless true and certain even of real things
existing; because real things are no farther concerned nor intended to
be meant by any such propositions, than as things really agree to those
archetypes in his mind. Is it true of the idea of a triangle, that its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>
three angles are equal to two right ones? It is true also of a triangle
wherever it really exists. Whatever other figure exists that is not exactly
answerable to that idea in his mind is not at all concerned in that
proposition. And therefore he is certain all his knowledge concerning
such ideas is real knowledge: because, intending things no farther than
they agree with those his ideas, he is sure what he knows concerning
those figures when they have barely an ideal existence in his mind will
hold true of them also when they have a real existence in matter." But
"that any or what bodies do exist, that we are left to our senses to
discover to us as far as they can."<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Locke accordingly distinguishes between 'mental truth'
and 'real truth.'<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> The former is intuitively certain; the
latter dependent on experience. Only <i>hypothetically</i> can we
affirm intuitive truths of real things&mdash;by <i>supposing</i>, namely,
that real things exist which correspond exactly with the
ideal subjects of the intuitive propositions.</p>

<p>If our senses corroborate the supposition all goes well.
But note the strange descent in Locke's hands of the dignity
of <i>a priori</i> propositions. By the ancients they were
considered, without farther question, to reveal the constitution
of Reality. Archetypal things existed, it was assumed,
in the relations in which we had to think them. The mind's
necessities were a warrant for those of Being; and it was not
till Descartes' time that scepticism had so advanced (in 'dogmatic'
circles) that the warrant must itself be warranted,
and the veracity of the Deity invoked as a reason for holding
fast to our natural beliefs.</p>

<p>But the intuitive propositions of Locke leave us as regards
outer reality none the better for their possession.
We still have to "go to our senses" to find what the
reality is. The vindication of the intuitionist position
is thus a barren victory. The eternal verities which
the very structure of our mind lays hold of do not necessarily
themselves lay hold on extra-mental being, nor have
they, as Kant pretended later,<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> a legislating character even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>
for all possible experience. They are primarily interesting
only as subjective facts. They stand waiting in the mind,
forming a beautiful ideal network; and the most we can
say is that we <i>hope</i> to discover outer realities over which the
network may be flung so that ideal and real may coincide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And this brings us back to 'science' from which we diverted
our attention so long ago (see <a href="#Page_640">p. 640</a>). Science thinks
that she has discovered the outer realities in question.
Atoms and ether, with no properties but masses and velocities
expressible by numbers, and paths expressible by analytic
formulas, these at last are things over which the
mathematico-logical network may be flung, and by supposing
which instead of sensible phenomena science becomes
yearly more able to manufacture for herself a world about
which rational propositions may be framed. Sensible phenomena
are pure delusions for the mechanical philosophy.
The 'things' and qualities we instinctively believe in do
not exist. The only realities are swarming solids in everlasting
motion, undulatory or continued, whose expressionless
and meaningless changes of position form the history
of the world, and are deducible from initial collocations
and habits of movement hypothetically assumed. Thousands
of years ago men started to cast the chaos of nature's
sequences and juxtapositions into a form that might seem
intelligible. Many were their ideal prototypes of rational
order: teleological and æsthetic ties between things, causal
and substantial bonds, as well as logical and mathematical
relations. The most promising of these ideal systems at first
were of course the richer ones, the sentimental ones. The
baldest and least promising were the mathematical ones; but
the history of the latter's application is a history of steadily
advancing successes, whilst that of the sentimentally richer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>
systems is one of relative sterility and failure.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Take those
aspects of phenomena which interest you as a human being
most, and class the phenomena as perfect and imperfect, as
ends and means to ends, as high and low, beautiful and ugly,
positive and negative, harmonious and discordant, fit and
unfit, natural and unnatural, etc., and barren are all your
results. In the ideal world the kind 'precious' has characteristic
properties. What is precious should be preserved;
unworthy things should be sacrificed for its sake;
exceptions made on its account; its preciousness is a reason
for other things' actions, and the like. But none of
these things need happen to your 'precious' object in the
real world. Call the things of nature as much as you like
by sentimental, moral, and æsthetic names, no natural
consequences follow from the naming. They may be of
the kinds you allege, but they are not of '<i>the kind's kind</i>':
and the last great system-maker of this sort, Hegel, was
obliged explicitly to repudiate logic in order to make any
inferences at all from the names he called things by.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But when you give things mathematical and mechanical
names and call them just so many solids in just such positions,
describing just such paths with just such velocities,
all is changed. Your sagacity finds its reward in the verification
by nature of all the deductions which you may next
proceed to make. Your 'things' realize all the <i>consequences</i>
of the names by which you classed them. The modern
mechanico-physical philosophy of which we are all so
proud, because it includes the nebular cosmogony, the
conservation of energy, the kinetic theory of heat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>
gases, etc., etc., begins by saying that the <i>only</i> facts are
collocations and motions of primordial solids, and the only
laws the changes of motion which changes in collocation
bring. The ideal which this philosophy strives after is a
mathematical world-formula, by which, if all the collocations
and motions at a given moment were known, it would
be possible to reckon those of any wished-for future moment,
by simply considering the necessary geometrical,
arithmetical, and logical implications. Once we have the
world in this bare shape, we can fling our net of <i>a priori</i>
relations over all its terms, and pass from one of its phases
to another by inward thought-necessity. Of course it is a
world with a very minimum of rational <i>stuff</i>. The sentimental
facts and relations are butchered at a blow. But
the rationality yielded is so superbly complete in <i>form</i> that
to many minds this atones for the loss, and reconciles the
thinker to the notion of a purposeless universe, in which
all the things and qualities men love, <i>dulcissima mundi
nomina</i>, are but illusions of our fancy attached to accidental
clouds of dust which will be dissipated by the eternal
cosmic weather as carelessly as they were formed.</p>

<p>The popular notion that 'Science' is forced on the mind
<i>ab extra</i>, and that our interests have nothing to do with its
constructions, is utterly absurd. The craving to believe
that the things of the world belong to kinds which are related
by inward rationality together, is the parent of Science
as well as of sentimental philosophy; and the original investigator
always preserves a healthy sense of how plastic
the materials are in his hands.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Once for all," says Helmholtz in beginning that little work of his
which laid the foundations of the 'conservation of energy,' "it is the
task of the physical sciences to seek for laws by which particular processes
in nature may be referred to general rules, and deduced from
such again. Such rules (for example the laws of reflection or refraction
of light, or that of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac for gas-volumes) are
evidently nothing but generic-concepts for embracing whole classes of
phenomena. The search for them is the business of the experimental
division of our Science. Its theoretic division, on the other hand,
tries to discover the unknown causes of processes from their visible
effects; tries to understand them by the law of causality.... The
ultimate goal of theoretic physics is to find the last <i>unchanging</i> causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span>
of the processes in Nature. Whether all processes be really ascribable
to such causes, whether, in other words, <i>nature be completely intelligible,</i>
or whether there be changes which would elude the law of a necessary
causality, and fall into a realm of spontaneity or freedom, is not here
the place to determine; but at any rate it is clear that the Science
whose aim it is to make nature appear intelligible [<i>die Natur zu
begreifen</i>] must start with the <i>assumption</i> of her intelligibility, and
draw consequences in conformity with this assumption, until irrefutable
facts show the limitations of this method.... The postulate that
natural phenomena must be reduced to changeless ultimate causes next
shapes itself so that <i>forces unchanged by time</i> must be found to be
these causes. Now in Science we have already found portions of matter
with changeless forces (indestructible qualities), and called them
(chemical) elements. If, then, we imagine the world composed of elements
with inalterable qualities, the only changes that can remain
possible in such a world are spatial changes, i.e. movements, and the
only outer relations which can modify the action of the forces are
spatial too, or, in other words, the forces are motor forces dependent
for their effect only on spatial relations. More exactly still: The phenomena
of nature must be reduced to [<i>zurückgeführt</i>, conceived as,
classed as] motions of material points with inalterable motor forces
acting according to space-relations alone.... But points have no
mutual space-relations except their distance,... and a motor force
which they exert upon each other can cause nothing but a change of
distance&mdash;i.e. be an attractive or a repulsive force.... And its intensity
can only depend on distance. So that at last the task of Physics
resolves itself into this, to refer phenomena to inalterable attractive
and repulsive forces whose intensity varies with distance. The solution
of this task would at the same time be the condition of Nature's
complete intelligibility."<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The subjective interest leading to the assumption could
not be more candidly expressed. What makes the assumption
'scientific' and not merely poetic, what makes a Helmholtz
and his kin <i>discoverers</i>, is that the things of Nature
turn out to act as if they <i>were</i> of the kind assumed. They
behave as such mere drawing and driving atoms would behave;
and so far as they have been distinctly enough translated
into molecular terms to test the point, so far a certain
fantastically ideal object, namely, the mathematical sum
containing their mutual distances and velocities, is found to
be constant throughout all their movements. This sum is
called the total energy of the molecules considered. Its constancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>
or 'conservation' gives the name to the hypothesis
of molecules and central forces from which it was logically
deduced.</p>

<p>Take any other mathematico-mechanical theory and it
is the same. They are all translations of sensible experiences
into other forms, substitutions of items between which
ideal relations of kind, number, form, equality, etc., obtain,
for items between which no such relations obtain; coupled
with declarations that the experienced form is false and the
ideal form true, declarations which are justified by the appearance
of new sensible experiences at just those times
and places at which we logically infer that their ideal correlates
ought to be. Wave-hypotheses thus make us predict
rings of darkness and color, distortions, dispersions,
changes of pitch in sonorous bodies moving from us,
etc.; molecule-hypotheses lead to predictions of vapor-density,
freezing point, etc.,&mdash;all which predictions fall true.</p>

<p>Thus the world grows more orderly and rational to the
mind, which passes from one feature of it to another by deductive
necessity, as soon as it conceives it as made up of
so few and so simple phenomena as bodies with no properties
but number and movement to and fro.</p>


<h4>METAPHYSICAL AXIOMS.</h4>


<p>But alongside of these ideal relations between terms
which the world verifies, there are other ideal relations not
as yet so verified. I refer to those propositions (no longer
expressing mere results of comparison) which are formulated
in such metaphysical and æsthetic axioms as "The
Principle of things is one;" "The quantity of existence is
unchanged;" "Nature is simple and invariable;" "Nature
acts by the shortest ways;" "<i>Ex nihilo nihil fit;</i>" "Nothing
can be evolved which was not involved;" "Whatever
is in the effect must be in the cause;" "A thing can only
work where it is;" "A thing can only affect another of its
own kind;" "<i>Cessante causa, cessat et effectus;</i>" "Nature
makes no leaps;" "Things belong to discrete and permanent
kinds;" "Nothing is or happens without a reason;"
"The world is throughout rationally intelligible;" etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>
etc., etc. Such principles as these, which might be multiplied
to satiety,<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> are properly to be called <i>postulates of
rationality</i>, not propositions of fact. If nature <i>did</i> obey
them, she <i>would</i> be <i>pro tanto</i> more intelligible; and we seek
meanwhile so to conceive her phenomena as to show that
she does obey them. To a certain extent we succeed. For
example, instead of the 'quantity of existence' so vaguely
postulated as unchanged, Nature allows us to suppose that
curious sum of distances and velocities which for want of
a better term we call 'energy.' For the effect being 'contained
in the cause,' nature lets us substitute 'the effect <i>is</i>
the cause,' so soon as she lets us conceive both effect and
cause as the same molecules, in two successive positions.&mdash;But
all around these incipient successes (as all around the
molecular world, so soon as we add to it as its 'effects' those
illusory 'things' of common-sense which we had to butcher
for its sake), there still spreads a vast field of irrationalized
fact whose items simply <i>are</i> together, and from one to
another of which we can pass by no ideally 'rational' way.</p>

<p>It is not that these more metaphysical postulates of
rationality are absolutely barren&mdash;though barren enough
they were when used, as the scholastics used them, as
immediate propositions of fact.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> They have a fertility as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span>
ideals, and keep us uneasy and striving always to recast
the world of sense until its lines become more congruent
with theirs. Take for example the principle that 'nothing
can happen without a cause.' We have no definite idea of
what we mean by cause, or of what causality consists in. But
the principle expresses a demand for <i>some</i> deeper sort of
inward connection between phenomena than their merely
habitual time-sequence seems to us to be. The word 'cause'
is, in short, an altar to an unknown god; an empty pedestal
still marking the place of a hoped-for statue. <i>Any</i>
really inward belonging-together of the sequent terms, if
discovered, would be accepted as what the word cause was
meant to stand for. So we seek, and seek; and in the
molecular systems we find a sort of inward belonging in
the notion of identity of matter with change of collocation.
Perhaps by still seeking we may find other sorts of inward
belonging, even between the molecules and those 'secondary
qualities,' etc., which they produce upon our minds.</p>

<p>It cannot be too often repeated that the triumphant
application of any one of our ideal systems of rational relations
to the real world justifies our hope that other systems
may be found also applicable. Metaphysics should
take heart from the example of physics, simply confessing
that hers is the longer task. Nature <i>may</i> be remodelled,
nay, certainly will be remodelled, far beyond the point at
present reached. Just how far?&mdash;is a question which only
the whole future history of Science and Philosophy can
answer.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Our task being Psychology, we cannot even
cross the threshold of that larger problem.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besides the mental structure which results in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>
metaphysical principles as those just considered, there is
a mental structure which expresses itself in</p>


<h4>ÆSTHETIC AND MORAL PRINCIPLES.</h4>


<p>The æsthetic principles are at bottom such axioms as
that a note sounds good with its third and fifth, or that
potatoes need salt. We are once for all so made that when
certain impressions come before our mind, one of them will
seem to call for or repel the others as its companions. To
a certain extent the principle of habit will explain these
æsthetic connections. When a conjunction is repeatedly
experienced, the cohesion of its terms grows grateful, or at
least their disruption grows unpleasant. But to explain <i>all</i>
æsthetic judgments in this way would be absurd; for it is
notorious how seldom natural experiences come up to our
æsthetic demands. Many of the so-called metaphysical
principles are at bottom only expressions of æsthetic feeling.
Nature is simple and invariable; makes no leaps, or
makes nothing but leaps; is rationally intelligible; neither
increases nor diminishes in quantity; flows from one principle,
etc., etc.,&mdash;what do all such principles express save
our sense of how pleasantly our intellect would feel if it
had a Nature of that sort to deal with? The subjectivity
of which feeling is of course quite compatible with Nature
also turning out objectively to be of that sort, later on.</p>

<p>The <i>moral</i> principles which our mental structure engenders
are quite as little explicable <i>in toto</i> by habitual
experiences having bred inner cohesions. Rightness is not
<i>mere</i> usualness, wrongness not <i>mere</i> oddity, however numerous
the facts which might be invoked to prove such identity.
Nor are the moral judgments those most invariably and
emphatically impressed on us by public opinion. The
most characteristically and peculiarly moral judgments
that a man is ever called on to make are in unprecedented
cases and lonely emergencies, where no popular
rhetorical maxims can avail, and the hidden oracle alone
can speak; and it speaks often in favor of conduct
quite unusual, and suicidal as far as gaining popular
approbation goes. The forces which conspire to this
resultant are subtle harmonies and discords between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span>
elementary ideas which form the data of the case. Some of
these harmonies, no doubt, have to do with habit; but
in respect to most of them our sensibility must assuredly
be a phenomenon of supernumerary order, correlated with
a brain-function quite as secondary as that which takes
cognizance of the diverse excellence of elaborate musical
compositions. No more than the higher musical sensibility
can the higher moral sensibility be accounted for by the
frequency with which outer relations have cohered.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Take
judgments of justice or equity, for example. Instinctively,
one judges everything differently, according as it pertains
to one's self or to some one else. Empirically one notices
that everybody else does the same. But little by little
there dawns in one the judgment "nothing can be right for
me which would not be right for another similarly placed;"
or "the fulfilment of my desires is intrinsically no more imperative
than that of anyone else's;" or "what it is reasonable
that another should do for me, it is also reasonable
that I should do for him;"<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> and forthwith the whole mass
of the habitual gets overturned. It gets <i>seriously</i> overturned
only in a few fanatical heads. But its overturning
is due to a back-door and not to a front-door process.
Some minds are preternaturally sensitive to logical consistency
and inconsistency. When they have ranked a
thing under a kind, they <i>must</i> treat it as of that kind's
kind, or feel all out of tune. In many respects we do class
ourselves with other men, and call them and ourselves by
a common name. They agree with us in having the same
Heavenly Father, in not being consulted about their birth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
in not being themselves to thank or blame for their natural
gifts, in having the same desires and pains and pleasures,
in short in a host of fundamental relations. Hence, <i>if these
things be our essence,</i> we should be substitutable for other
men, and they for us, in any proposition in which either
of us is involved. The more fundamental and common
the essence chosen, and the more simple the reasoning,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>
the more wildly radical and unconditional will the justice
be which is aspired to. Life is one long struggle between
conclusions based on abstract ways of conceiving cases, and
opposite conclusions prompted by our instinctive perception
of them as individual facts. The logical stickler
for justice always seems pedantic and mechanical to
the man who goes by tact and the particular instance,
and who usually makes a poor show at argument. Sometimes
the abstract conceiver's way is better, sometimes that
of the man of instinct. But just as in our study of reasoning
we found it impossible to lay down any mark whereby
to distinguish <i>right</i> conception of a concrete case from <i>confusion</i>
(see <a href="#Page_336">pp. 336</a>, <a href="#Page_350">350</a>), so here we can give no general
rule for deciding when it is morally useful to treat a concrete
case as <i>sui generis</i>, and when to lump it with others
in an abstract class.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span></p>
<p>An adequate treatment of the way in which we come by
our æsthetic and moral judgments would require a separate
chapter, which I cannot conveniently include in this book.
Suffice it that these judgments express inner harmonies
and discords between objects of thought; and that whilst
outer cohesions frequently repeated will often seem harmonious,
all harmonies are not thus engendered, but our
feeling of many of them is a secondary and incidental function
of the mind. Where harmonies are asserted of the
real world, they are obviously mere postulates of rationality,
so far as they transcend experience. Such postulates
are exemplified by the ethical propositions that the individual
and universal good are one, and that happiness and
goodness are bound to coalesce in the same subject.</p>


<h4>SUMMARY OF WHAT PRECEDES.</h4>


<p>I will now sum up our progress so far by a short summary
of the most important conclusions which we have
reached.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span></p>
<p>The mind has a native structure in this sense, that certain
of its objects, if considered together in certain ways,
give definite results; and that no other ways of considering,
and no other results, are possible if the same objects
be taken.</p>

<p>The results are 'relations' which are all expressed by
judgments of subsumption and of comparison.</p>

<p>The judgments of subsumption are themselves subsumed
under the <i>laws of logic</i>.</p>

<p>Those of comparison are expressed in <i>classifications</i>, and
in the <i>sciences of arithmetic and geometry</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer's opinion that our consciousness of classificatory,
logical, and mathematical relations between ideas is
due to the frequency with which the corresponding 'outer
relations' have impressed our minds, is unintelligible.</p>

<p>Our consciousness of these relations, no doubt, has a
natural genesis. But it is to be sought rather in the inner
forces which have made the brain grow, than in any mere
paths of 'frequent' association which outer stimuli may
have ploughed in that organ.</p>

<p>But let our sense for these relations have arisen as it
may, the relations themselves form a fixed system of lines
of cleavage, so to speak, in the mind, by which we naturally
pass from one object to another; and the objects connected
by these lines of cleavage are often not connected by any
regular time- and space-associations. We distinguish,
therefore, between the empirical order of things, and this
their rational order of comparison; and, so far as possible,
we seek to translate the former into the latter, as being the
more congenial of the two to our intellect.</p>

<p>Any classification of things into kinds (especially if the
kinds form series, or if they successively involve each
other) is a more rational way of conceiving the things than
is that mere juxtaposition or separation of them as individuals
in time and space which is the order of their crude
perception. Any assimilation of things to terms between
which such classificatory relations, with their remote and
mediate transactions, obtain, is a way of bringing the things
into a more rational scheme.</p>

<p>Solids in motion are such terms; and the mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span>
philosophy is only a way of conceiving nature so as to
arrange its items along some of the more natural lines of
cleavage of our mental structure.</p>

<p>Other natural lines are the moral and æsthetic relations.
Philosophy is still seeking to conceive things so that these
relations also may seem to obtain between them.</p>

<p>As long as things have not successfully been so conceived,
the moral and æsthetic relations obtain only between
<i>entia rationis</i>, terms in the mind; and the moral and æsthetic
principles remain but postulates, not propositions, with
regard to the real world outside.</p>

<p>There is thus a large body of <i>a priori</i> or intuitively
necessary truths. As a rule, these are truths of <i>comparison</i>
only, and in the first instance they express relations between
merely mental terms. Nature, however, acts as if
some of her realities were identical with these mental
terms. So far as she does this, we can make <i>a priori</i> propositions
concerning natural fact. The aim of both science
and philosophy is to make the identifiable terms more
numerous. So far it has proved easier to identify nature's
things with mental terms of the mechanical than with mental
terms of the sentimental order.</p>

<p>The widest postulate of rationality is that the world <i>is</i>
rationally intelligible throughout, after the pattern of <i>some</i>
ideal system. The whole war of the philosophies is over
that point of faith. Some say they can see their way
already to the rationality; others that it is hopeless in any
other but the mechanical way. To some the very fact that
there is a world at all seems irrational. Nonentity would be
a more natural thing than existence, for these minds. One
philosopher at least says that the relatedness of things to
each other is irrational anyhow, and that a world of relations
can never be made intelligible.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>With this I may be assumed to have completed the
programme which I announced at the beginning of the chapter,
so far as the <i>theoretic</i> part of our organic mental structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>
goes. It can be due neither to our own nor to our ancestors'
experience. I now pass to those practical parts of
our organic mental structure. Things are a little different
here; and our conclusion, though it lies in the same direction,
can be by no means as confidently expressed.</p>

<p>To be as short and simple as possible, I will take the
case of instincts, and, supposing the reader to be familiar
with <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIV360">Chapter XXIV</a>, I will plunge <i>in medias res</i>.</p>


<h4>THE ORIGIN OF INSTINCTS.</h4>


<p>Instincts must have been either</p>

<p>1) Each specially created in complete form, or</p>

<p>2) Gradually evolved.</p>

<p>As the first alternative is nowadays obsolete, I proceed
directly to the second. The two most prominent suggestions
as to the way in which instincts may have been evolved
are associated with the names of Lamarck and Darwin.</p>

<p>Lamarck's statement is that animals have <i>wants</i>, and
contract, to satisfy them, <i>habits</i> which transform themselves
gradually into so many propensities which they can neither
resist nor change. These <i>propensities</i>, once acquired, propagate
themselves by way of transmission to the young, so
that they come to exist in new individuals, anteriorly to all
exercise. Thus are the same emotions, the same habits,
the same <i>instincts</i>, perpetuated without variation from one
generation to another, so long as the outward conditions
of existence remain the same.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Mr. Lewes calls this the
theory of 'lapsed intelligence.' Mr. Spencer's words are
clearer than Lamarck's, so that I will quote from him:<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"Setting out with the unquestionable assumption, that every new
form of emotion making its appearance in the individual or the race is
a modification of some pre-existing emotion, or a compounding of
several pre-existing emotions, we should be greatly aided by knowing
what always are the pre-existing emotions. When, for example, we
find that very few, if any, of the lower animals show any love of accumulation,
and that this feeling is absent in infancy; when we see that
an infant in arms exhibits anger, fear, wonder, while yet it manifests
no desire of permanent possession; and that a brute which has no acquisitive
emotion can nevertheless feel attachment, jealousy, love of approbation,&mdash;we
may suspect that the feeling which property satisfies is
compounded out of simpler and deeper feelings. We may conclude
that as when a dog hides a bone there must exist in him a prospective
gratification of hunger, so there must similarly, at first, in all cases
where anything is secured or taken possession of, exist an ideal excitement
of the feeling which that thing will gratify. We may further conclude
that when the intelligence is such that a variety of objects come to
be utilized for different purposes; when, as among savages, divers wants
are satisfied through the articles appropriated for weapons, shelter,
clothing, ornament,&mdash;the act of appropriating comes to be one constantly
involving agreeable associations, and one which is therefore
pleasurable, irrespective of the end subserved. And when, as in civilized
life, the property acquired is of a kind not conducing to one order
of gratifications, but is capable of ministering to all gratifications, the
pleasure of acquiring property grows more distinct from each of the
various pleasures subserved&mdash;is more completely differentiated into a
separate emotion.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> It is well known that on newly-discovered islands
not inhabited by man, birds are so devoid of fear as to allow themselves
to be knocked over with sticks, but that in the course of generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span>
they acquire such a dread of man as to fly on his approach, and
that this dread is manifested by young as well as old. Now unless this
change be ascribed to the killing off of the least fearful, and the preservation
and multiplication of the more fearful, which, considering the
small number killed by man, is an inadequate cause, it must be ascribed
to accumulated experiences, and each experience must be held to have
a share in producing it. We must conclude that in each bird that escapes
with injuries inflicted by man, or is alarmed by the outcries of
other members of the flock,... there is established an association of
ideas between the human aspect and the pains, direct and indirect, suffered
from human agency. And we must further conclude that the
state of consciousness which impels the bird to take flight is at first
nothing more than an ideal reproduction of those painful impressions
which before followed man's approach; that such ideal reproduction
becomes more vivid and more massive as the painful experiences, direct
or sympathetic, increase; and that thus the emotion, in its incipient
state, is nothing else than an aggregation of the revived pains before
experienced. As, in the course of generations, the young birds of this
race begin to display a fear of man before they have been injured by
him, it is an unavoidable inference that the nervous system of the race
has been organically modified by these experiences; we have no choice
but to conclude that when a young bird is thus led to fly, it is because
the impression produced on its senses by the approaching man entails,
through an incipiently reflex action, a partial excitement of all those
nerves which, in its ancestors, had been excited under the like conditions;
that this partial excitement has its accompanying painful consciousness;
and that the vague painful consciousness thus arising constitutes
emotion proper&mdash;<i>emotion undecomposable into specific experiences,
and therefore seemingly homogeneous. If such be the explanation
of the fact in this case, then it is in all cases. If the emotion
is so generated here, then it is so generated throughout.</i> If so, we must
perforce conclude that the emotional modifications displayed by different
nations, and those higher emotions by which civilized are distinguished
from savage, are to be accounted for on the same principle.
And, concluding this, we are led strongly to suspect that the emotions
in general have severally thus originated."<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Obviously the word 'emotion' here means instinct as
well,&mdash;the actions we call instinctive are expressions or
manifestations of the emotions whose genesis Mr. Spencer
describes. Now if habit could thus bear fruit outside the
individual life, and if the modifications so painfully acquired
by the parents' nervous systems could be found
ready-made at birth in those of the young, it would be hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>
to overestimate the importance, both practical and theoretical,
of such an extension of its sway. In principle, instincts
would then be assimilated to 'secondarily-automatic'
habits, and the origin of many of them out of tentative experiments
made during ancestral lives, perfected by repetition,
addition, and association through successive generations,
would be a comparatively simple thing to understand.</p>

<p>Contemporary students of instinct have accordingly
been alert to discover all the facts which would seem to
establish the possibility of such an explanation. The list
is not very long, considering what a burden of conclusions
it has to bear. Let acquisitiveness and fear of man, as just
argued for by Spencer, lead it off. Other cases of the latter
sort are the increased shyness of the woodcock noticed to
have occurred within sixty years' observation by Mr. T. A.
Knight, and the greater shyness everywhere shown by large
than by small birds, to which Darwin has called attention.
Then we may add&mdash;</p>

<p>The propensities of 'pointing,' 'retrieving,' etc., in
sporting dogs, which seem partly, at any rate, to be due to
training, but which in well-bred stock are all but innate.
It is in these breeds considered bad for a litter of young if
its sire or dam have not been trained in the field.</p>

<p>Docility of domestic breeds of horses and cattle.</p>

<p>Tameness of young of tame rabbit&mdash;young wild rabbits
being invincibly timid.</p>

<p>Young foxes are most wary in those places where they
are most severely hunted.</p>

<p>Wild ducks, hatched out by tame ones, fly off. But if
kept close for some generations, the young are said to become
tame.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>Young savages at a certain age will revert to the woods.</p>

<p>English greyhounds taken to the high plateau of Mexico
could not at first run well, on account of rarefied air. Their
whelps entirely got over the difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewes somewhere<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> tells of a terrier pup whose
parents had been taught to 'beg,' and who constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span>
threw himself spontaneously into the begging attitude.
Darwin tells of a French orphan-child, brought up out of
France, yet <i>shrugging</i> like his ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>Musical ability often increases from generation to generation
in the families of musicians.</p>

<p>The hereditarily epileptic guinea-pigs of Brown-Séquard,
whose parents had become epileptic through surgical
operations on the spinal cord or sciatic nerve. The adults
often lose some of their hind toes, and the young, in addition
to being epileptic, are frequently born with the corresponding
toes lacking. The offspring of guinea-pigs whose
cervical sympathetic nerve has been cut on one side will
have the ear larger, the eyeball smaller, etc., just like their
parents after the operation. Puncture of the 'restiform
body' of the medulla will, in the same animal, congest and
enlarge one eye, and cause gangrene of one ear. In the
young of such parents the same symptoms occur.</p>

<p>Physical refinement, delicate hands and feet, etc., appear
in families well-bred and rich for several generations.</p>

<p>The 'nervous' temperament also develops in the descendants
of sedentary brain-working people.</p>

<p>Inebriates produce offspring in various ways degenerate.</p>

<p>Nearsightedness is produced by indoor occupation for
generations. It has been found in Europe much more frequent
among schoolchildren in towns than among children
of the same age in the country.</p>

<p>These latter cases are of the inheritance of structural
rather than of functional peculiarities. But as structure
gives rise to function it may be said that the principle is
the same. Amongst other inheritances of adaptive<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> structural
change may be mentioned:</p>

<p>The 'Yankee' type.</p>

<p>Scrofula, rickets, and other diseases of bad conditions
of life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span></p>
<p>The udders and permanent milk of the domestic breeds
of cow.</p>

<p>The 'fancy' rabbit's ears, drooping through lack of
need to erect them. Dog's, ass's, etc., in some breeds
ditto.</p>

<p>The obsolete eyes of mole and various cave-dwelling

<blockquote>

<p>"It would," says he, "be the most serious error to suppose that the
greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation,
and then transmitted by inheritance in succeeding generations.
It can clearly be shown that the most wonderful instincts with which
we are acquainted, namely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants,
could not possibly have been thus acquired.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> It will be universally admitted
that instincts are as important as corporeal structure for the welfare
of each species, under its present conditions of life. Under changed
conditions of life, it is at least possible that slight modifications of instinct
might be profitable to a species; and if it can be shown that instincts
do vary ever so little, then I can see no difficulty in natural
selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct
to any extent that may be profitable. It is thus, as I believe, that all
the most complex and wonderful instincts have arisen.... I believe
that the effects of habit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects
of the natural selection of what may be called accidental variations of
instincts;&mdash;that is, of variations produced by the same unknown causes
which produce slight deviations of bodily structure."<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span></p>
<p>The evidence for Mr. Darwin's view is too complex to
be given in this place. To my own mind it is quite convincing.
If, with the Darwinian theory in mind, one re-reads
the list of examples given in favor of the Lamarckian theory,
one finds that many of the cases are irrelevant, and that
some make for one side as well as for the other. This is
so obvious in many of the cases that it is needless to point
it out in detail. The shrugging child and the begging pup,
e.g., prove somewhat too much. They are examples so
unique as to suggest spontaneous variation rather than inherited
habit. In other cases the observations much need
corroboration, e.g., the effects of not training for a generation
in sporting dogs and race-horses, the difference between
young wild rabbits born in captivity and young tame ones,
the cumulative effect of many generations of captivity on
wild ducks, etc.</p>

<p>Similarly, the increased wariness of the large birds, of
those on islands frequented by men, of the woodcock, of
the foxes, may be due to the fact that the bolder families
have been killed off, and left none but the naturally timid
behind, or simply to the individual experience of older
birds being imparted by example to the young so that a
new <i>educational tradition</i> has occurred.&mdash;The cases of physical
refinement, nervous temperament, Yankee type, etc.,
also need much more discriminating treatment than they
have yet received from the Lamarckians. There is no real
evidence that physical refinement and nervosity tend to accumulate
from generation to generation in aristocratic or
intellectual families; nor is there any that the change in
that direction which Europeans transplanted to America
undergo is not all completed in the first generation of
children bred on our soil. To my mind, the facts all point
that way. Similarly the better breathing of the greyhounds
born in Mexico was surely due to a post-natal
adaptation of the pups' thorax to the rarer air.</p>

<p>Distinct neurotic <i>degeneration</i> may undoubtedly accumulate
from parent to child, and as the parent usually in this
case grows worse by his own irregular habits of life, the
temptation lies near to ascribe the child's deterioration to
this cause. This, again, is a hasty conclusion. For neurotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>
degeneration is unquestionably a disease whose original
causes are unknown; and like other 'accidental variations'
it is hereditary. But it ultimately ends in sterility; and it
seems to me quite unfair to draw any conclusions from its
natural history in favor of the transmission of acquired
peculiarities. Nor does the degeneration of the children of
alcoholics prove anything in favor of their having inherited
the shattered nervous system which the alcohol has induced
in their parents: because the poison usually has a chance
to directly affect their own bodies before birth, by acting
on the germinal matter from which they are formed whilst
it is still nourished by the alcoholized blood of the parent.
In many cases, moreover, the parental alcoholics are themselves
degenerates neurotically, and the drink-habit is only
a symptom of their disease, which in some form or other
they also propagate to their children.</p>

<p>There remain the inherited mutilations of the guinea-pig.
But these are such startling exceptions to the ordinary
rule with animals that they should hardly be used as examples
of a typical process. The docility of domestic
cattle is certainly in part due to man's selection, etc., etc.
In a word, the proofs form rather a beggarly array.</p>

<p>Add to this that the writers who have tried to carry out
the theory of transmitted habit with any detail are always
obliged <i>somewhere</i> to admit inexplicable variation. Thus
Spencer allows that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sociality can begin only where, through some slight variation, there
is less tendency than usual for the individuals to disperse.... That
slight variations of mental nature, sufficient to initiate this process, may
be fairly assumed, all our domestic animals show us: differences in their
characters and likings are conspicuous. Sociality having thus commenced,
and survival of the fittest tending ever to maintain and increase it, it
will be further strengthened by the inherited effects of habit."<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> Again,
in writing of the pleasure of pity, Mr. Spencer says: "This feeling is
not one that has arisen through the inherited effects of experiences, but
belongs to a quite different group, traceable to the survival of the fittest
simply&mdash;to the natural selection of incidental variations. In this group
are included all the bodily appetites, together with those simpler instincts,
sexual and parental, by which every race is maintained; and
which must exist before the higher processes of mental evolution can
commence."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span></p>
<p>The inheritance of tricks of manner and trifling peculiarities,
such as handwriting, certain odd gestures when
pleased, peculiar movements during sleep, etc., have also
been quoted in favor of the theory of transmission of acquired
habits. Strangely enough; for of all things in the
world these tricks seem most like idiosyncratic variations.
They are usually defects or oddities which the education
of the individual, the pressure of what is really <i>acquired</i>
by him, would counteract, but which are too native to be
repressed, and breaks through all artificial barriers, in his
children as well as in himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I leave my text practically just as it was written in 1885.
I proceeded at that time to draw a tentative conclusion to
the effect that the origin of <i>most</i> of our instincts must certainly
be deemed fruits of the back-door method of genesis,
and not of ancestral experience in the proper meaning of
the term. Whether acquired ancestral habits played any
part at all in their production was still an open question in
which it would be as rash to affirm as to deny. Already
before that time, however, Professor Weismann of Freiburg
had begun a very serious attack upon the Lamarckian
theory,<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> and his polemic has at last excited such a widespread
interest among naturalists that the whilom almost unhesitatingly
accepted theory seems almost on the point of
being abandoned.</p>

<p>I will therefore add some of Weismann's criticisms of the
supposed evidence to my own. In the first place, he has a
captivating theory of descent of his own,<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> which makes him
think it <i>a priori</i> impossible that any peculiarity acquired
during lifetime by the parent should be transmitted to the
germ. Into the nature of that theory this is not the place
to go. Suffice to say that it has made him a keener critic
of Lamarck's and Spencer's theory than he otherwise might
have been. The only way in which the germinal products
can be influenced whilst in the body of the parent is, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span>
to Weismann, by good or bad nutrition. Through this
they may degenerate in various ways or lose vitality altogether.
They may also be infected through the blood by
small-pox, syphilis, or other virulent diseases, and otherwise
be poisoned. But peculiarities of neural structure and
habit in the parents <i>which the parents themselves were not
born with</i>, they can never acquire unless perhaps accidentally
through some coincidental variation of their own.
<i>Accidental</i> variations develop of course into idiosyncrasies
which tend to pass to later generations in virtue of the
well-known law which no one doubts.</p>

<p>Referring to the often-heard assertion that the increase
of talent found in certain families from one generation to
another is due to the transmitted effects of <i>exercise</i> of the
faculty concerned (the Bachs, the Bernoullis, Mozart, etc.),
he sensibly remarks, that the talent being kept in exercise,
it ought to have gone on growing for an indefinite number
of generations. As a matter of fact, it quickly reaches a
maximum, and then we hear no more of it, which is what
happens always when an idiosyncrasy is exposed to the effects
of miscellaneous intermarriage.</p>

<p>The hereditary epilepsy and other degenerations of the
operated guinea-pigs are explained by Professor Weismann
as results of <i>infection</i> of the young by the parent's
blood. The latter he supposes to undergo a pathologic
change in consequence of the original traumatic injury. The
obsolescence of disused organs he explains very satisfactorily,
without invoking any transmission of the direct effects of
disuse, by his theory of <i>panmixy</i>, for which I must refer to
his own writings. Finally, he criticises searchingly the
stories we occasionally hear of inherited mutilations in
animals (dogs' ears and tails, etc.), and cites a prolonged
series of experiments of his own on mice, which he bred for
many generations, cutting off both parental tails each time,
without interfering in the least with the length of tail with
which the young continued to be born.</p>

<p>The strongest argument, after all, in favor of the Lamarckian
theory remains the <i>a priori</i> one urged by Spencer
in his little work (much the solidest thing, by the way, which
he has ever written) 'The Factors of Organic Evolution.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span>
Since, says Mr. Spencer, the accidental variations of all
parts of the body are independent of each other, if the
entire organization of animals were due to such accidental
variations alone, the amount of mutual adaptation and harmony
that we now find there could hardly possibly have
come about in any finite time. We must rather suppose that
the divers varying parts <i>brought</i> the other parts into harmony
with themselves by <i>exercising them ad hoc</i>, and that
the effects of the exercise remained and were passed on to
the young. This forms, of course, a great <i>presumption</i> against
the all-sufficiency of the view of selection of accidental
variations exclusively. But it must be admitted that in
favor of the contrary view, that adaptive changes are inherited,
we have as yet perhaps not one single unequivocal
item of positive proof.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I must therefore end this chapter on the genesis of our
mental structure by reaffirming my conviction that the so-called
Experience-philosophy has failed to prove its point.
No more if we take ancestral experiences into account than
if we limit ourselves to those of the individual after birth,
can we believe that the couplings of terms within the mind
are simple copies of corresponding couplings impressed
upon it by the environment. This indeed is true of a small
part of our cognitions. But so far as logical and mathematical,
ethical, æsthetical, and metaphysical propositions
go, such an assertion is not only untrue but altogether
unintelligible; for these propositions say nothing about
the time- and space-order of things, and it is hard to understand
how such shallow and vague accounts of them as
Mill's and Spencer's could ever have been given by thinking
men.</p>

<p>The causes of our mental structure are doubtless natural,
and connected, like all our other peculiarities, with those of
our nervous structure. Our interests, our tendencies of attention,
our motor impulses, the æsthetic, moral, and
theoretic combinations we delight in, the extent of our
power of apprehending schemes of relation, just like the
elementary relations themselves, time, space, difference and
similarity, and the elementary kinds of feeling, have all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span>
grown up in ways of which at present we can give no account.
Even in the clearest parts of Psychology our insight
is insignificant enough. And the more sincerely one seeks
to trace the actual course of <i>psychogenesis</i>, the steps by
which as a race we may have come by the peculiar mental
attributes which we possess, the more clearly one perceives
"the slowly gathering twilight close in utter night."</p>

found that dogs become mild in character when their occipital, and fierce
when their frontal, brain-lobes are cut off. "A dog which originally was
cross in an extreme degree, never suffering himself to be touched, and
even refusing, after two days' fasting, to take a piece of bread from my
hand, became, after a bilateral operation on the occipital lobes, perfectly
trustful and harmless. He underwent five operations on these parts....
Each one of them made him more good-natured; so that at last (just as
Goltz observed of his dogs) he would let other dogs take away the very
bones which he was gnawing" (Loeb, Pflüger's Archiv, xxxix. 300). A
course of kind treatment and training might have had a similar effect.
But how absurd to call two such different causes by the same name, and
to say both times that the beast's 'experience of outer relations' is what
educates him to good-nature. This, however, is virtually what all writers
do who ignore the distinction between the 'front-door' and the back-door'
manners of producing mental change.
</p>
<p>
One of the most striking of these back-door affections is <i>susceptibility
to the charm of drunkenness</i>. This (taking drunkenness in the broadest
sense, as teetotalers use the word) is one of the deepest functions of human
nature. Half of both the poetry and the tragedy of human life would
vanish if alcohol were taken away. As it is, the thirst for it is such that
in the United States the cash-value of its sales amounts to that of the sales
of meat and of bread put together. And yet what ancestral 'outer relation'
is responsible for this peculiar reaction of ours? The only 'outer
relation' could be the alcohol itself, which, comparatively speaking, came
into the environment but yesterday, and which, so far from creating, is
tending to eradicate, the love of itself from our mental structure, by letting
only those families of men survive in whom it is not strong. The love of
drunkenness is a purely accidental susceptibility of a brain, evolved for
entirely different uses, and its causes are to be sought in the molecular
realm, rather than in any possible order of 'outer relations.'</p></div>

viii. 498), seeks to show that accidental morphological changes in the
brain cannot possibly be imagined to result in any mental change of a sort
which would <i>fit the animal to its environment</i>. If spontaneous variation
ever works on the brain, its product, says Mr. Allen, ought to be an idiot
or a raving madman, not a minister and interpreter of Nature. Only the
environment can change us in the direction of accommodation <i>to itself</i>.
But I think we ought to know a little better just what the molecular
changes in the brain are on which thought depends, before we talk so confidently
about what the effect can be of their possible variations. Mr.
Allen, it should be said, has made a laudable effort to conceive them distinctly.
To me his conception remains too purely anatomical. Meanwhile
this essay and another by the same author in the Atlantic Monthly are
probably as serious attempts as any that have been made towards applying

of distinct consequents. This, supposing it done, will not of itself tell us
on which of the antecedents each consequent is invariably attendant. To
determine that point, we must endeavor to effect a separation of the facts

<p><a name="Footnote_532_532" id="Footnote_532_532"></a><a href="#FNanchor_532_532"><span class="label">[532]</span></a> I quote from an address entitled 'Reflex Action and Theism,' published
in the 'Unitarian Review' for November 1881, and translated in
the Critique Philosophique for January and February 1882. "The conceiving
or theorizing faculty works exclusively for the sake of ends that
do not exist at all in the world of the impressions received by way of our
senses, but are set by our emotional and practical subjectivity. It is a
transformer of the world of our impressions into a totally different world,
the world of our conception; and the transformation is effected in the
interests of our volitional nature, and for no other purpose whatsoever.
Destroy the volitional nature, the definite subjective purposes, preferences,
fondness for certain effects, forms, orders, and not the slightest motive
would remain for the brute order of our experience to be remodelled at all.
But, as we have the elaborate volitional constitution we do have, the remodelling
must be effected, there is no escape. The world's contents are
<i>given</i> to each of us in an order so foreign to our subjective interests that we
can hardly by an effort of the imagination picture to ourselves what it is
like. We have to break that order altogether, and by picking out from it
the items that concern us, and connecting them with others far away,
which we say 'belong' with them, we are able to make out definite threads
of sequence and tendency, to foresee particular liabilities and get ready for
them, to enjoy simplicity and harmony in the place of what was chaos.
Is not the sum of your actual experience taken at this moment and impartially
added together an utter chaos? The strains of my voice, the lights
and shades inside the room and out, the murmur of the wind, the ticking
of the clock, the various organic feelings you may happen individually to
possess, do these make a whole at all? Is it not the only condition of your
mental sanity in the midst of them that most of them should become non-existent
for you, and that a few others&mdash;the sounds, I hope, which I am
uttering&mdash;should evoke from places in your memory, that have nothing to
do with this scene, associates fitted to combine with them in what we call
a rational train of thought?&mdash;rational because it leads to a conclusion we
have some organ to appreciate. We have no organ or faculty to appreciate
the simply given order. The real world as it is given at this moment is
the sum total of all its beings and events now. But can we think of such
a sum? Can we realize for an instant what a cross-section of all existence
at a definite point of time would be? While I talk and the flies buzz, a
sea gull catches a fish at the mouth of the Amazon, a tree falls in the
Adirondack wilderness, a man sneezes in Germany, a horse dies in Tartary,
and twins are born in France. What does that mean? Does the contemporaneity
of these events with each other and with a million more as disjointed
as they form a rational bond between them, and unite them into
anything that means for us a world? Yet just such a collateral contemporaneity,
and nothing else, is the <i>real</i> order of the world. It is an order
with which we have nothing to do but to get away from it as fast as possible.
As I said, we break it: we break it into histories, and we break it
into arts, and we break it into sciences; and then we begin to feel at home.
We make ten thousand separate serial orders of it. On any one of these,
we may react as if the rest did not exist. We discover among its parts relations
that were never given to sense at all,&mdash;mathematical relations, tangents,
squares, and roots and logarithmic functions,&mdash;and out of an infinite
number of these we call certain ones essential and lawgiving, and ignore
the rest. Essential these relations are, but only <i>for our purpose</i>, the other
relations being just as real and present as they; and our purpose is to <i>conceive
simply</i> and <i>to foresee</i>. Are not simple conception and prevision subjective
ends, pure and simple? They are the ends of what we call science;
and the miracle of miracles, a miracle not yet exhaustively cleared up by
any philosophy, is that the given order lends itself to the remodelling. It
shows itself plastic to many of our scientific, to many of our æsthetic, to
many of our practical purposes and ends." Cf. also Hodgson: Philos. of
Refl., ch. v; Lotze: Logik, §§ 342-351; Sigwart: Logik, §§ 60-63, 105.</p></div>

associations as lead us to expect that what has happened to us will happen
again. These associations lead the babe to look for milk from its nurse
and not from its father, the child to believe that the apple he sees will
taste good; and whilst they make him wish for it, they make him fear the
bottle which contains his bitter medicine. But whereas a part of these
associations grows confirmed by frequent repetition, another part is destroyed
by contradictory experiences; and the world becomes divided for
us into two provinces, one in which we are at home and anticipate with
confidence always the same sequences; another filled with alternating,
variable, accidental occurrences....
</p>
<p>
"Accident is, in a wide sphere, such an every-day matter that we
need not be surprised if it sometimes invades the territory where order is
the rule. And one personification or another of the capricious power of
chance easily helps us over the difficulties which further reflection might
find in the exceptions. Yes, indeed, Exception has a peculiar fascination;
it is a subject of astonishment, a θαῦμα, and the credulity with which in
this first stage of pure association we adopt our supposed rules is matched
by the equal credulity with which we adopt the miracles that interfere with
them.
</p>
<p>
"The whole history of popular beliefs about nature refutes the notion
that the thought of an universal physical order can possibly have arisen
through the purely passive reception and association of particular perceptions.
Indubitable as it is that all men infer from known cases to unknown,
it is equally certain that this procedure, if restricted to the phenomenal
materials that spontaneously offer themselves, would never have led to
the belief in a general uniformity, but only to the belief that law and lawlessness
rule the world in motley alternation. From the point of view of
strict empiricism nothing exists but the sum of particular perceptions with
their coincidences on the one hand, their contradictions on the other.
</p>
<p>
"That there is more order in the world than appears at first sight is not
discovered till the order is looked for. The first impulse to look for it proceeds
from practical needs: where ends must be attained, we must know
trustworthy means which infallibly possess a property or produce a result.
But the practical need is only the first occasion for our reflection on the
conditions of a true knowledge; even were there no such need, motives
would still be present to carry us beyond the stage of mere association.
For not with an equal interest, or rather with an equal lack of interest,
does man contemplate those natural processes in which like is joined to
like, and those in which like and unlike are joined; the former processes
harmonize with the conditions of his thinking, the latter do not; in the
former his concepts, judgments, inferences apply to realities, in the
latter they have no such application. And thus the intellectual satisfaction
which at first comes to him without reflection, at last excites in him
the conscious wish to find realized throughout the entire phenomenal world
those rational continuities, uniformities, and necessities which are the fundamental
element and guiding principle of his own thought." (C. Sigwart:
Logik, ii. 380-2.)</p></div>

present generation, is so sucked in with his mother's milk by every one of
us, that we find it hard to conceive of a creature who should not feel it,
and harder still to treat it freely as the altogether peculiar and one-sided
subjective interest which it is. But as a matter of fact, few even of the
cultivated members of the race have shared it; it was invented but a generation
or two ago. In the middle ages it meant only impious magic; and
the way in which it even now strikes orientals is charmingly shown in the
letter of a Turkish cadi to an English traveller asking him for statistical
information, which Sir A. Bayard prints at the end of his 'Nineveh and
Babylon.' The document is too full of edification not to be given in full.
It runs thus:
</p>
<p>
"<i>My Illustrious Friend, and Joy of my Liver!</i>
</p>
<p>
"The thing you ask of me is both difficult and useless. Although I
have passed all my days in this place, I have neither counted the houses
nor inquired into the number of the inhabitants; and as to what one person
loads on his mules and the other stows away in the bottom of his ship, that
is no business of mine. But, above all, as to the previous history of this
city, God only knows the amount of dirt and confusion that the infidels
may have eaten before the coming of the sword of Islam. It were unprofitable
for us to inquire into it.
</p>
<p>
"O my soul! O my lamb! seek not after the things which concern
thee not. Thou camest unto us and we welcomed thee: go in peace.
</p>
<p>
"Of a truth thou hast spoken many words; and there is no harm done,
or the speaker is one and the listener is another. After the fashion of thy
people thou hast wandered from one place to another, until thou art happy
and content in none. We (praise be to God) were born here, and never
desire to quit it. Is it possible, then, that the idea of a general intercourse
between mankind should make any impression on our understandings?
God forbid!
</p>
<p>
"Listen, O my son! There is no wisdom equal unto the belief in God!
He created the world, and shall we liken ourselves unto Him in seeking to
penetrate into the mysteries of His creation? Shall we say, Behold this
star spinneth round that star, and this other star with a tail goeth and
cometh in so many years! Let it go! He from whose hand it came will
guide and direct it.
</p>
<p>
"But thou wilt say unto me, Stand aside, O man, for I am more
learned than thou art, and have seen more things. If thou thinkest that
thou art in this respect better than I am, thou art welcome. I praise God
that I seek not that which I require not. Thou art learned in the things I
care not for; and as for that which thou hast seen, I spit upon it. Will
much knowledge create thee a double belly, or wilt thou seek Paradise
with thine eyes?
</p>
<p>
"O my friend! if thou wilt be happy, say, There is no God but
God! Do no evil, and thus wilt thou fear neither man nor death: for
surely thine hour will come!
</p>
<p>

at another time would produce a sweet one, yet the idea of bitter in that
man's mind would be as clear and distinct from the idea of sweet as if he
had tasted only gall. Nor does it make any more confusion between the
two ideas of sweet and bitter that the same sort of body produces at one
time one and at another time another idea by the taste, than it makes a
confusion in two ideas of white and sweet, or white and round, that the
same piece of sugar produces them both in the mind at the same time."

whether the <i>a priori</i> truths are 'analytic' or 'synthetic.' It seems to me
that the distinction is one of Kant's most unhappy legacies, for the reason
that it is impossible to make it sharp. No one will say that such analytic
judgments as "equidistant lines can nowhere meet" are <i>pure</i> tautologies.
The predicate is a somewhat new way of conceiving as well as of naming
the subject. There is <i>something</i> 'ampliative' in our greatest truisms, our
state of mind is richer after than before we have uttered them. This
being the case, the question "at what point does the new state of mind
cease to be <i>implicit</i> in the old?" is too vague to be answered. The only
sharp way of defining synthetic propositions would be to say that they express
a relation between <i>two data</i> at least. But it is hard to find any proposition
which cannot be construed as doing this. Even verbal definitions
do it. Such painstaking attempts as that latest one by Mr. D. G. Thompson
to prove all necessary judgments to be analytic (System of Psychology,
ii. pp. 232 ff.) seem accordingly but <i>nugæ difficiles</i>, and little better than
wastes of ink and paper. All philosophic interest vanishes from the
question, the moment one ceases to ascribe to <i>any a priori</i> truths
(whether analytic or synthetic) that "legislative character for all possible
experience" which Kant believed in. We ourselves have denied such
legislative character, and contended that it was for experience itself to
prove whether its data can or cannot be assimilated to those ideal terms
between which <i>a priori</i> relations obtain. The analytic-synthetic debate is
thus for us devoid of all significance. On the whole, the best recent treatment
of the question known to me is in one of A. Spir's works, his Denken
und Wirklichkeit, I think, but I cannot now find the page.</p></div>

showing that the forms of our necessary thought are underived from experience.
He insisted on thought-forms with which experience largely
<i>agrees</i>, forgetting that the only forms which could not by any possibility
be the results of experience would be such as experience <i>violated</i>. The
first thing a Kantian ought to do is to discover forms of judgment to which
<i>no</i> order in 'things' runs parallel. These would indeed be features native
to the mind. I owe this remark to Herr A. Spir, in whose 'Denken und
Wirklichkeit' it is somewhere contained. I have myself already to some
extent proceeded, and in the pages which follow shall proceed still farther,
to show the originality of the mind's structure in this way.</p></div>

language: so in perusing the volume of nature methinks it is beneath the
dignity of the mind to affect an exactness in reducing each particular phenomenon
to general rules, or showing how it follows from them. We
should propose to ourselves nobler views, namely, to recreate and exalt the
mind with a prospect of the beauty, order, extent, and variety of natural
things: hence, by proper inferences, to enlarge our notions of the grandeur,
wisdom, and beneficence of the Creator," etc., etc., etc. (Principles
of Human Knowledge, § 109.)</p></div>

'<i>nemo dat quod non habet</i>,' in this refutation of 'Darwinism,' which I take
from the much-used scholastic compendium of Logic and Metaphysics of
Liberatore, 3d ed. (Rome, 1880): "Hæc hypothesis... aperte contradicit
principiis Metaphysicæ, quæ docent essentias rerum esse immutabiles,
et effectum non posse superare causam. Et sane, quando, juxta
Darwin, species inferior se evolvit in superiorem, unde trahit maiorem illam
nobilitatem? Ex ejus carentia. At nihil dat quod non habet; et minus
gignere nequit plus, aut negatio positionem. Præterea in transformatione
quæ fingitur, nature prioris speciei, servatur aut destruitur? Si primum,
mutatio erit tantum accidentalis, qualem reapse videmus in diversis stirpibus
animantium. Sin alterum asseritur, ut reapse fert hypothesis darwiniana,
res tenderet ad seipsam destruendam; cum contra omnia naturaliter
tendant ad sui conservationem, et nonnisi per actionem contrarii agentis
corruant." It is merely a question of fact whether these ideally proper
relations do or do not obtain between animal and vegetable ancestors and
descendants. If they do not, what happens? simply this, that we cannot
continue to class animal and vegetal facts under the <i>kinds</i> between which
those ideal relations obtain. Thus, we can no longer call animal breeds by
the name of 'species'; cannot call generating a kind of 'giving,' or treat a
descendant as an 'effect' of his ancestor. The ideal scheme of terms and
relations can remain, if you like; but it must remain purely mental, and
without application to life, which 'gangs its ain gait' regardless of ideal
schemes. Most of us, however, would prefer to doubt whether such abstract
axioms as that 'a thing cannot tend to its own destruction' express ideal
relations of an important sort at all.</p></div>

view of justice by treating cases as if they belonged rigorously to abstract
classes. Pure rationalism, complete immunity from prejudice, consists in refusing
to see that the case before one is absolutely unique. It is always possible
to treat the country of one's nativity, the house of one's fathers, the bed
in which one's mother died, nay, the mother herself if need be, on a naked
equality with all other specimens of so many respective genera. It shows
the world in a clear frosty light from which all fuliginous mists of affection,
all swamp-lights of sentimentality, are absent. Straight and immediate
action becomes easy then&mdash;witness a Napoleon's or a Frederick's career.
But the question always remains, "Are not the mists and vapors <i>worth</i> retaining?"
The illogical refusal to treat certain concretes by the mere law
of their genus has made the drama of human history. The obstinate insisting
that tweedledum is <i>not</i> tweedledee is the bone and marrow of life.
Look at the Jews and the Scots, with their miserable factions and sectarian
disputes, their loyalties and patriotisms and exclusions,&mdash;their annals
now become a classic heritage, because men of genius took part and
sang in them. A thing is important if any one <i>think</i> it important. The
process of history consists in certain folks becoming possessed of the mania
that certain special things are important infinitely, whilst other folks cannot
agree in the belief. The Shah of Persia refused to be taken to the
Derby Day, saying "It is already known to me that one horse can run faster
than another." He made the question "<i>which</i> horse?" immaterial. Any
question can be made immaterial by subsuming all its answers under a
common head. Imagine what college ball-games and races would be if the
teams were to forget the absolute distinctness of Harvard from Yale and
think of both as One in the higher genus College. The sovereign road to
indifference, whether to evils or to goods, lies in the thought of the higher
genus. "When we have meat before us," says Marcus Aurelius, seeking
indifference to <i>that</i> kind of good, "we must receive the impression that
this is the dead body of a fish, and this is the dead body of a bird or of a
pig; and again that this Falernian is only a little grape-juice, and this purple
robe some sheep's wool dyed with the blood of a shell-fish. Such, then,
are these impressions, and they reach the things themselves and penetrate
them, and we see what kind of things they are. Just in the same way
ought we to act through life, and where there are things which appear
most worthy of our approbation, we ought to lay them bare and look at
their worthlessness and strip them of all the words by which they are exalted."
(Long's Translation, vi. 13.)</p></div>

is in his Principles of Psychology, in the chapter under that name.
Dr. Romanes has reformulated and criticised the doctrine of this chapter
in his Mental Evolution in Animals, chapter xvii. I must confess my inability
to state its vagueness in intelligible terms. It treats instincts as a
further development of reflex actions, and as forerunners of intelligence,&mdash;which
is probably true of many. But when it ascribes their formation to
the mere 'multiplication of experiences,' which, at first simple, mould
the nervous system to 'correspond to outer relations' by simple reflex
actions, and, afterwards complex, make it 'correspond' by 'compound
reflex actions,' it becomes too mysterious to follow without more of a key
than is given. The whole thing becomes perfectly simple if we suppose
the reflex actions to be accidental inborn idiosyncrasies preserved.</p></div>

the associationist account to be a true description of a great deal of
our proprietary feeling, we admitted in addition an entirely primitive form
of desire. (See above, <a href="#Page_420">p. 420</a> ff.) The reader must decide as to the plausibilities
of the case. Certainly appearances are in favor of there being in us <i>some</i>
cupidities quite disconnected with the ulterior uses of the things appropriated.
The source of their fascination lies in their appeal to our æsthetic
sense, and we wish thereupon simply to <i>own</i> them. Glittering, hard,
metallic, odd, pretty things; curious things especially; natural objects that
look as if they were artificial, or that mimic other objects,&mdash;these form a
class of things which human beings snatch at as magpies snatch rags. They
simply fascinate us. What house does not contain some drawer or cupboard
full of senseless odds and ends of this sort, with which nobody knows
what to do, but which a blind instinct saves from the ash-barrel? Witness
people returning from a walk on the sea-shore or in the woods, each
carrying some <i>lusus naturæ</i> in the shape of stone or shell, or strip of bark
or odd-shaped fungus, which litter the house and grow daily more unsightly,
until at last reason triumphs over blind propensity and sweeps them away.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
